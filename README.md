# React Native Chat

# Philosophy
This application is built with the following principles.
1. **Offline first** - All data that is brought into the app should be stored immediately in Ion which puts the data into persistent storage (eg. localStorage on browser platforms).
1. **UI Binds to Ion** - UI components bind to Ion so that any change to the Ion data is automatically reflected in the component by calling setState() with the changed data.
1. **Actions manage Ion Data** - When the UI needs to request or write data from the server, this is done through Actions exclusively.
    1. Actions should never return data, see the first point. Example:  if the action is `fetchReports()`, it does not return the reports, `fetchReports()` returns nothing. The action makes an XHR, then puts the data into Ion (using `Ion.set()` or `Ion.merge()`). Any UI that is subscribed to that piece of data in Ion is automatically updated.
1. **Cross Platform 99.9999%**
    1. A feature isn't done until it works on all platforms.  Accordingly, don't even bother writing a platform-specific code block because you're just going to need to undo it.
    1. If the reason you can't write cross platform code is because there is a bug in ReactNative that is preventing it from working, the correct action is to fix RN and submit a PR upstream -- not to hack around RN bugs with platform-specific code paths.
    1. If there is a feature that simply doesn't exist on all platforms and thus doesn't exist in RN, rather than doing if (platform=iOS) { }, instead write a "shim" library that is implemented with NOOPs on the other platforms.  For example, rather than injecting platform-specific multi-tab code (which can only work on browsers, because it's the only platform with multiple tabs), write a TabManager class that just is NOOP for non-browser platforms.  This encapsulates the platform-specific code into a platform library, rather than sprinkling through the business logic.
    1. Put all platform specific code in a dedicated branch, like /platform, and reject any PR that attempts to put platform-specific code anywhere else.  This maintains a strict separation between business logic and platform code.

# Local development
## Getting started
1. Install `node` & `npm`: `brew install node`
2. Install `watchman`: `brew install watchman`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run `cp .env.example .env` and edit `.env` to have your local config options(for example, we are curretly hardcoding the pinned chat reports IDs with the `REPORT_IDS` config option).
## Running the web app ðŸ•¸
* To run a **Development Server**: `npm run web`
* To build a **production build**: `npm run build`
* Changes applied to Javascript will be applied automatically via WebPack as configured in `webpack.dev.js`

## Running the iOS app ðŸ“±
* To install the iOS dependencies, run: `cd ios/ && pod install`
* To run a on a **Development Simulator**: `npm run ios`
    * If the app is booting on a simulator for the first time, run the following two commands:
    ```bash
    xcrun simctl keychain booted add-root-cert ~/Expensidev/config/ssl/rootCA.crt #Adds root cert and trusts it
    xcrun simctl keychain booted add-cert ~/Expensidev/config/ssl/expensify.com.dev.pem #Adds .dev cert and trusts it
    ```
* Changes applied to Javascript will be applied automatically, any changes to native code will require a recompile

## Running the Android app ðŸ¤–
* Running via `ngrok` is required to communicate with the API
    * Start ngrok (`Expensidev/script/ngrok.sh`), replace `expensify.com.dev` value in `.env` with your ngrok value
* To run a on a **Development Emulator**: `npm run android`
* Changes applied to Javascript will be applied automatically, any changes to native code will require a recompile

## Running the MacOS desktop app ðŸ–¥
 * To run the **Development app**, run: `npm run desktop`, this will start a new Electron process running on your MacOS desktop in the `dist/Mac` folder.

## Running the tests ðŸŽ°
* To run the **Jest Unit Tests**: `npm run test`

## Troubleshooting
1. If you are having issues with **_Getting Started_**, please reference [React Native's Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
2. If you are running into issues communicating with `expensify.com.dev` (CORS, SSL, etc.), running via `ngrok` is recommended, see step 3 in **_Getting Started_**

## Debugging
1. If running on the iOS simulator `âŒ˜D`, or `âŒ˜M` on Android emulator will open the debugging menu. 
2. This will allow you to attach a debugger in your IDE, React Developer Tools, or your browser. 
3. For more information on how to attach a debugger, see [React Native Debugging Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#chrome-developer-tools)

# Deploying 
##  Continuous deployment / GitHub workflows
Every PR merged into `master` will kick off the **Create a new version** GitHub workflow defined in `.github/workflows/version.yml`.
It will look at the current version and increment it by one build version (using [`react-native-version`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-version)), create a PR with that new version, and tag the version.

The PR will be merged automatically by the GitHub workflow **automerge** to keep the version always up to date.

When a new tag is pushed, it will trigger a deploy of all four clients:
1. The **web** app automatically deploys via a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/main.yml`
2. The **MacOS desktop** app automatically deploys via a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/desktop.yml`
3. The **Android** app automatically deploys via a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/android.yml`
4. The **iOS** app automatically deploys via a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/ios.yml`

## Local production build
Sometimes it might be beneficial to generate a local production version instead of testing on production. Follow the steps below for each client:

## Local production build of the web app
In order to generate a production web build, run `npm run build`, this will generate a production javascript build in the `dist/` folder.

## Local production build of the MacOS desktop app
In order to compile a production desktop build, run `npm run desktop-build`, this will generate a production app in the `dist/Mac` folder named `Chat.app`.
  
#### Local production build the iOS app
In order to compile a production iOS build, run `npm run ios-build`, this will generate a `Chat.ipa` in the root directory of this project. 

#### Local production build the Android app
To build an APK to share run (e.g. via Slack), run `npm run android-build`, this will generate a new APK in the `android/app` folder.
