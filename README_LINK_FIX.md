# Fix for Back Navigation Issues with Whisper Message Links

## Issue Description

When users clicked on links in invite whisper messages (such as "Their expense chat" or "Workspace member settings"), the back button navigation was broken. Instead of returning to the original room conversation, users were redirected to unexpected locations like the Inbox or workspace sections.

### Specific Problem Cases
1. **"Their expense chat" link**: Back button took users to Inbox instead of original room
2. **"Workspace member settings" link**: Back button took users to workspace profile instead of original room
3. **Device back button**: Sometimes didn't trigger any action at all

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in `src/libs/actions/Link.ts` in the `openLink` function:

```typescript
// Before (problematic code)
Navigation.navigate(reportRoute);
Navigation.navigate(internalNewExpensifyPath as Route);
```

The problem was that `Navigation.navigate()` without options defaults to using the NAVIGATE action type, which **replaces** the current route in the navigation stack instead of **pushing** a new route. This breaks the back navigation chain.

### Why This Happened

The `linkTo` function (called by `Navigation.navigate()`) has logic on lines 112-119 that determines:
- For most cases, it wants to **PUSH** by default to add entries to the browser history (enabling proper back navigation)
- However, when no `forceReplace` option is specified, the default behavior doesn't guarantee PUSH action

## Solution Implemented

Modified the `openLink` function in `src/libs/actions/Link.ts` to explicitly use `{forceReplace: false}` option:

```typescript
// After (fixed code)
Navigation.navigate(reportRoute, {forceReplace: false});
Navigation.navigate(internalNewExpensifyPath as Route, {forceReplace: false});
```

### Why This Works

1. **`{forceReplace: false}`** ensures that the navigation uses PUSH action instead of REPLACE
2. **PUSH action** preserves the navigation stack, allowing proper back navigation
3. **Maintains browser history** entries so back button works correctly
4. **No impact on external links** - the fix only affects internal navigation

## Files Modified

### `src/libs/actions/Link.ts`
- **Lines 173 & 184**: Added `{forceReplace: false}` option to Navigation.navigate calls
- **Added comments**: Explaining the purpose of the change

### `tests/unit/LinkNavigationTest.ts` (New file)
- Comprehensive test suite covering:
  - ReportID URL navigation with proper back navigation options
  - Workspace member settings URL navigation
  - Expense chat URL navigation
  - Edge cases and error handling
  - Explicit verification that `forceReplace: false` is used

## Testing

### Test Cases Added
1. **reportID URLs**: Ensures navigation to reports preserves back navigation
2. **Internal workspace URLs**: Verifies workspace settings links work correctly
3. **Edge cases**: Handles malformed URLs gracefully
4. **External links**: Confirms no impact on external link behavior
5. **Back navigation preservation**: Explicitly tests that `forceReplace: false` is used

### Test Command
```bash
npm test -- tests/unit/LinkNavigationTest.ts
```

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Open a workspace expense chat**
2. **Mention a user who is not a member** (triggers invite whisper)
3. **Choose "Invite to submit expenses"**
4. **Click on "Their expense chat" link** in the confirmation message
5. **Click back button** → Should return to original room, not Inbox
6. **Click on "Workspace member settings" link**
7. **Click back button** → Should return to original room, not workspace profile

## Impact Assessment

### ✅ Positive Impacts
- **Fixed back navigation** for whisper message links
- **Improved user experience** - users can navigate back as expected
- **Preserved all existing functionality** - no breaking changes
- **Added comprehensive tests** to prevent regressions

### ⚠️ Considerations
- **No impact on performance** - minimal change to existing code
- **No API changes required** - frontend-only fix
- **Backward compatible** - existing functionality unchanged

## Related Issues

- **GitHub Issue #68142**: Room - Incorrect navigation of back button when navigating to links on invite system message
- **GitHub PR #68188**: Change Invite whisper actions with fixed links
- **Deploy blocker**: This issue caused multiple reverts of the invite feature

## Future Improvements

1. **Consider adding navigation tests** to CI pipeline to catch similar issues early
2. **Review other usages** of `Navigation.navigate()` without options to ensure consistency
3. **Add E2E tests** for the complete invite whisper flow including navigation

## Notes for QA

When testing the invite whisper functionality, specifically verify:
- Back navigation works correctly from all whisper message links
- Device back button functions properly
- No unintended side effects on other navigation flows
- Links work correctly across different platforms (web, mobile)
