# Red Brick Road and Green Brick Road Philosophy
The Red Brick Road (RBR) and Green Brick Road (GBR) are each a method to direct a user down a clear path of actions to take or errors to fix. It is intended to help the user have a clearly defined set of steps to follow in order to resolve something. It can lead you to take an action anywhere in the Inbox, Reports, Workspaces, or Account.


## Green Brick Road (GBR)
Generally, the GBR shows up when there is a pending action to take or item to review. This section is broken down into examples for each section where the Green Brick Road will appear.

### Inbox
Any chats in the left hand navigation (LHN) that require attention will in most cases show up in the highest context chat.
For example:
- There is a report pending approval by an admin
- There is a report pending submission by an employee
- There is a report waiting to be paid by the admin
- There is a report queued for reimbursement but the employee needs to add a deposit bank account
- An Expensify Card has been issued to an employee but the employee needs to add their shipping details
- A user is mentioned in a report comment

### Workspaces
For example:
- If the billing owner had to retry billing and the retry was successful

### Account
For example:
- A user has an unvalidated contact method


## Red Brick Road (RBR)
Generally, the RBR shows up when there is an error or violation that needs fixing. This section is broken down into examples for each section where the Red Brick Road will appear.
