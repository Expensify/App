# Onyx Data Management
This is how the application manages all the data stored in Onyx.

- [Data Binding Philosophy](/contributingGuides/philosophies/DATA-BINDING.md)

#### Terminology
- **Actions** - The files stored in `/src/libs/actions`
- **Derived Values** - Special Onyx keys containing values computed from other Onyx values
- **Collections** - Multiple related data objects stored as individual keys with IDs
- **canBeMissing** - Parameter indicating whether a component expects Onyx data to be present

## Rules
### - Actions MUST be the only means to write or read data from the server
### - Actions SHOULD use `Onyx.merge()` rather than `Onyx.set()`
This improves performance and lessons the chance that one action will overwrite the changes made by another action.

### - UI Components MUST NOT call Onyx methods directly and should call an action instead
### - Data SHOULD be optimistically stored on disk whenever possible without waiting for a server response
Example of creating a new optimistic comment:
1. User adds a comment
2. Comment is shown immediately in the UI with optimistic data
3. Comment is created in the server
4. Server responds
5. UI updates with data from the server

### - Collections SHOULD be stored as individual keys when components bind directly to them
Store collections as individual keys+ID (e.g., `report_1234`, `report_4567`) when a component will bind directly to one of those keys. For example: reports are stored as individual keys because `OptionRow.js` binds to the individual report keys for each link. However, report actions are stored as an array of objects because nothing binds directly to a single report action.

### - Onyx keys MUST be defined using constants in `ONYXKEYS`
Each Onyx key represents either a collection of items or a specific entry in storage. For example, since all reports are stored as individual keys like `report_1234`, if code needs to know about all the reports (e.g., display a list of them in the nav menu), then it MUST subscribe to the key `ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT`.

### - Storage eviction MUST be configured for non-critical data
Different platforms come with varying storage capacities and Onyx has a way to gracefully fail when those storage limits are encountered.

**To flag a key as safe for removal:**
- Add the key to the `evictableKeys` option in `Onyx.init(options)`
- Implement `canEvict` in the Onyx config for each component subscribing to a key
- The key will only be deleted when all subscribers return `true` for `canEvict`

Example:
```js
Onyx.init({
    evictableKeys: [ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_ACTIONS],
});

const [reportActions] = useOnyx(`${ONYXKEYS.COLLECTION.REPORT_ACTIONS}${reportID}`, {canEvict: !isActiveReport});
```

## Onyx Derived Values

Derived values are special Onyx keys which contain values derived from other Onyx values. These are available as a performance optimization, so that if the result of a common computation of Onyx values is needed in many places across the app, the computation can be done only as needed in a centralized location, and then shared across the app. Once created, Onyx derived values are stored and consumed just like any other Onyx value.

### - Derived values SHOULD be used for complex computations across multiple components
When multiple components need the same computed value from one or more Onyx keys, and:
- The computation is expensive (e.g., filtering large arrays, complex object transformations)
- The result needs to be cached and shared to avoid redundant calculations
- The computation appears in frequently rendered components
- Profiling shows the same calculation being done repeatedly

### - Derived values SHOULD be used for data aggregation and transformation
When you need to:
- Combine data from multiple Onyx keys into a single, normalized structure
- The transformation logic is complex and reusable
- The derived data structure is used in multiple places
- The value depends on multiple pieces of state that can change independently

### - Derived values SHOULD NOT be used for simple or component-specific logic
Avoid derived values when:
- The computation is trivial (e.g., simple string manipulation, basic math)
- The value is only used in one component
- The computation is specific to a single component's UI state
- The logic involves component-local state
- The computed value is only needed temporarily
- The computation depends on non-Onyx values

### - New derived values MUST follow the proper creation process
1. Add the new Onyx key to `ONYXKEYS.ts` in the `ONYXKEYS.DERIVED` object
2. Declare the type for the derived value in `ONYXKEYS.ts` in the `OnyxDerivedValuesMapping` type
3. Add the derived value config to `ONYX_DERIVED_VALUES` in `src/libs/OnyxDerived.ts`

A derived value config MUST include:
1. The Onyx key for the derived value
2. An array of dependent Onyx keys (which can be any keys, including other derived values)
3. A `compute` function that takes an array of dependent Onyx values and returns a value matching the declared type

### - Derived value computations MUST be pure and predictable
```typescript
// GOOD ✅
compute: ([reports, personalDetails]) => {
  // Pure function, only depends on input
  return reports.map(report => ({
    ...report,
    authorName: personalDetails[report.authorID]?.displayName
  }));
}

// BAD ❌
compute: ([reports]) => {
  // Don't use external state or cause side effects
  const currentUser = getCurrentUser(); // External dependency!
  sendAnalytics('computation-done'); // Side effect!
  return reports;
}
```

### - Derived value computations SHOULD handle edge cases properly
```typescript
// GOOD ✅
compute: ([reports, personalDetails]: [Report[], PersonalDetails]): DerivedType => {
  if (!reports?.length || !personalDetails) {
    return { items: [], count: 0 };
  }
  // Rest of computation...
}

// BAD ❌
compute: ([reports, personalDetails]) => {
  // Missing type safety and edge cases
  return reports.map(report => personalDetails[report.id]);
}
```

### - Derived values SHOULD be well-documented
- Explain the purpose and dependencies
- Document any special cases or performance considerations
- Include type annotations for better developer experience

## canBeMissing Parameter

The `canBeMissing` parameter indicates whether a component connecting to Onyx expects the data to be present or if it can handle missing data gracefully.

### - Components MUST use the `canBeMissing` parameter appropriately
This parameter was added because in some places we are assuming some data will be there, but actually we never load it, which leads to hard to debug bugs.

The linter error exists until we add the param to all callers. Once that happens we can make the param mandatory and remove the linter.

### - `canBeMissing` SHOULD be set to `false` when data is guaranteed to be present
The main criteria for setting `canBeMissing` to `false`:

- **Data is always loaded before component renders**: If the data is always ensured to be loaded before this component renders, then `canBeMissing` SHOULD be set to `false`
- **Always returned by OpenApp**: Any data that is always returned by `OpenApp` used in a component where we have a user (so not in the homepage for example) will have `canBeMissing` set to `false`
- **User always has data**: Maybe we always try to load a piece of data, but the data can be missing/empty, in this case `canBeMissing` would be set to `false`

### - `canBeMissing` SHOULD be set to `true` for potentially missing data
If neither of the above conditions apply, then the param SHOULD probably be `true`, but additionally we MUST make sure that the code using the data manages correctly the fact that the data might be missing.
