## Proposal

### Please re-state the problem that we are trying to solve in this issue.

Problem: The autofill should look the same with the keyboard open and closed.

### What is the root cause of that problem?

It appears that the issue is related to the autofill functionality of the Display Name section in the user's profile settings.
It is caused by a conflict in the CSS styles or JavaScript code that is affecting the appearance and behavior of the autofill functionality. It is also related to the way the application is interacting with the mobile device's keyboard.


### What changes do you think we should make in order to solve the problem?

This could include reviewing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the Display Name section in the user's profile settings.

Use consistent styles: Ensure that consistent styles are being applied to the autofill functionality when the keyboard is open or closed. This could involve modifying the CSS code to ensure that the appearance of the autofill functionality is consistent in both scenarios.

Consider the mobile user experience: Consider the mobile user experience when making any changes. Ensure that any changes made to resolve the issue do not negatively impact the user experience or make the application difficult to use on mobile devices.

Test thoroughly: Test the application thoroughly on both the staging and production environments to ensure that the changes made have resolved the issue and have not introduced any new issues.

### What alternative solutions did you explore? (Optional)

here are some potential alternative solutions that could be explored to resolve the issue:

Use a different input method: Instead of relying on the default keyboard on mobile devices, consider using a custom input method that is designed to work well with the autofill functionality. This involve creating a custom input method within the application or using a third-party input method that is optimized for autofill.

Disable autofill: Another potential solution could be to disable the autofill functionality for the Display Name section in the user's profile settings. This could be a temporary workaround while a permanent solution is developed to address the issue.

Optimize CSS styles: Review and optimize the CSS styles used in the Display Name section to ensure that the layout and appearance are consistent in both scenarios when the keyboard is open or closed. This could involve modifying the styles used for the autofill functionality or changing the layout of the input fields.

Modify JavaScript code: If the issue is related to the way the application is interacting with the mobile device's keyboard, modifying the JavaScript code that controls this interaction could be a potential solution. This could involve changing the way the application detects the keyboard or modifies the layout of the user interface when the keyboard is open.

ATTN: Contributor+

You are the first line of defense in making sure every proposal has a clear and easily understood problem with a "root cause". Do not approve any proposals that lack a satisfying explanation to the first two prompts. It is CRITICALLY important that we understand the root cause at a minimum even if the solution doesn't directly address it. When we avoid this step we can end up solving the wrong problems entirely or just writing hacks and workarounds.

Instructions for how to review a proposal:

1. Address each contributor proposal one at a time and address each part of the question one at a time e.g. if a solution looks acceptable, but the stated problem is not clear then you should provide feedback and make suggestions to improve each prompt before moving on to the next. Avoid responding to all sections of a proposal at once. Move from one question to the next each time asking the contributor to "Please update your original proposal and tag me again when it's ready for review".

2. Limit excessive conversation and moderate issues to keep them on track. If someone is doing any of the following things please kindly and humbly course-correct them:

- Posting PRs.
- Posting large multi-line diffs (this is basically a PR).
- Skipping any of the required questions.
- Not using the proposal template at all.
- Suggesting that an existing issue is related to the current issue before a problem or root cause has been established.
- Excessively wordy explanations.

3. Choose the first proposal that has a reasonable answer to all the required questions.
