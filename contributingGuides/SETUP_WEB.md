# Web Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

### Web-Specific Prerequisites

1. **Install mkcert and Setup HTTPS**
   - Install `mkcert`: `brew install mkcert` followed by `npm run setup-https`. If you are not using macOS, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

2. **Configure Local Hosts**
   - Create a host entry in your local hosts file, `/etc/hosts` for dev.new.expensify.com pointing to localhost:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 dev.new.expensify.com
   ```

## Recommended Node Setup
In order to have more consistent builds, we use a strict `node` and `npm` version as defined in the `package.json` `engines` field and `.nvmrc` file. `npm install` will fail if you do not use the version defined, so it is recommended to install `node` via `nvm` for easy node version management. Automatic `node` version switching can be installed for [`zsh`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#zsh) or [`bash`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#bash) using `nvm`.

## Configuring HTTPS

The webpack development server now uses https. If you're using a mac, you can simply run `npm run setup-https`.

If you're using another operating system, you will need to ensure `mkcert` is installed, and then follow the instructions in the repository to generate certificates valid for `dev.new.expensify.com` and `localhost`. The certificate should be named `certificate.pem` and the key should be named `key.pem`. They should be placed in `config/webpack`.

## Running the Web App

### Development Server
- To run the **development web app**: `npm run web`
- Changes applied to Javascript will be applied automatically via WebPack as configured in `webpack.dev.ts`

### Production Build
To build and run the production web build locally:

```bash
# 1. Set USE_WEB_PROXY environment variable in .env.production
USE_WEB_PROXY=true

# 2. Build the production bundle
npm run build

# 3. Run the distribution server
npm run web:dist
```

The `web:dist` command starts both the proxy server (port 9000) and web server (port 8080) concurrently. Access the application at **http://localhost:8080**

## Environment Variables

Creating an `.env` file is not necessary. We advise external contributors against it. It can lead to errors when variables referenced here get updated since your local `.env` file is ignored.

### Key Variables for Web Development
- `NEW_EXPENSIFY_URL` - The root URL used for the website
- `SECURE_EXPENSIFY_URL` - The URL used to hit the Expensify secure API
- `EXPENSIFY_URL` - The URL used to hit the Expensify API
- `EXPENSIFY_PARTNER_NAME` - Constant used for the app when authenticating.
- `EXPENSIFY_PARTNER_PASSWORD` - Another constant used for the app when authenticating. (This is OK to be public)
- `PUSHER_APP_KEY` - Key used to authenticate with Pusher.com
- `USE_WEB_PROXY`⚠️- Used in web/desktop development, it starts a server along the local development server to proxy requests to the backend. External contributors should set this to `true` otherwise they'll have CORS errors. If you don't want to start the proxy server set this explicitly to `false`

### Optional Performance Variables
- `CAPTURE_METRICS` (optional) - Set this to `true` to capture performance metrics and see them in Flipper. See [PERFORMANCE.md](contributingGuides/PERFORMANCE.md#performance-metrics-opt-in-on-local-release-builds) for more information
- `ONYX_METRICS` (optional) - Set this to `true` to capture even more performance metrics and see them in Flipper. See [React-Native-Onyx#benchmarks](https://github.com/Expensify/react-native-onyx#benchmarks) for more information
- `USE_WDYR` - Flag to turn [`Why Did You Render`](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) testing on or off

> If your changes to .env aren't having an effect, try `rm -rf .rock`, then re-run `npm run web`

## Testing on Browsers in Simulators and Emulators

The development server is reached through the HTTPS protocol, and any client that access the development server needs a certificate.

You create this certificate by following the instructions in [`Configuring HTTPS`](#configuring-https) of this readme. When accessing the website served from the development server on browsers in iOS simulator or Android emulator, these virtual devices need to have the same certificate installed.

### All Platforms Setup
If you want to set up both iOS and Android simulators at once:
1. Run `npm run setupNewDotWebForEmulators all` or `npm run setupNewDotWebForEmulators`
2. Check if the iOS flow runs first and then Android flow runs.
3. Let the script execute till the message `🎉 Done!`.

## Debugging

### Browser DevTools
To make it easier to test things in web, we expose the Onyx object to the window, so you can easily do `Onyx.set('bla', 1)`.

### Release Profiling for Web
1. Install the necessary packages: `npm i`
2. Run your web app in production mode
3. Upon completion, the generated source map can be found at: `dist/merged-source-map.js.map`
4. To symbolicate traces: `npm run symbolicate-release:web`

### Recording Traces
1. Launch the app in production mode.
2. Navigate to the feature you wish to profile.
3. Initiate the profiling session by pressing `cmd+d` to open the menu and selecting **`Use Profiling`**.
4. Close the menu and interact with the app.
5. After completing your interactions, press `cmd+d` again and select to stop profiling.
6. You will be presented with a **`Share`** option to export the trace, which includes a trace file (`Profile<app version>.cpuprofile`) and build info (`AppInfo<app version>.json`).

### How to Symbolicate Trace Records
1. You have two files: `AppInfo<app version>.json` and `Profile<app version>.cpuprofile`
2. Place the `Profile<app version>.cpuprofile` file at the root of your project.
3. If you have already generated a source map from the steps above for this branch, you can skip to the next step. Otherwise, obtain the app version from `AppInfo<app version>.json` switch to that branch and generate the source map as described.

**IMPORTANT:** You should generate the source map from the same branch as the trace was recorded.

4. Use the following command to symbolicate the trace: `npm run symbolicate-release:web`
5. A new file named `Profile_trace_for_<app version>-converted.json` will appear in your project's root folder.
6. Open this file in your tool of choice:
   - SpeedScope ([https://www.speedscope.app](https://www.speedscope.app/))
   - Perfetto UI (https://ui.perfetto.dev/)
   - Google Chrome's Tracing UI (chrome://tracing)

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Errors
If you are running into CORS errors like (in the browser dev console):
```sh
Access to fetch at 'https://www.expensify.com/api/BeginSignIn' from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy
```
You probably have a misconfigured `.env` file - remove it (`rm .env`) and try again

### General Issues
1. If you are having issues with **_Getting Started_**, please reference [React Native's Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
2. Make sure you have the correct Node version installed as specified in `.nvmrc`
3. Ensure HTTPS is properly configured if you're having certificate issues

**Note:** Expensify engineers that will be testing with the API in your local dev environment please refer to [these additional instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/c/expensify/questions/7699/7700).
