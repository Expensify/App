# Performance Metrics

This project tracks various performance metrics to monitor and improve the application's efficiency and user experience.

## Tracked Metrics

The following table shows the key performance metrics that are being monitored in the application.

Project is using Firebase for tracking these metrics. However, not all of them are sent there - some of them are only used internally by the Performance module.

## Documentation Maintenance

To ensure this documentation remains accurate and useful, please adhere to the following guidelines when updating performance metrics:

1. **New Metrics**: When a new metric is introduced in the codebase, add it to the table with all relevant details.

2. **Metric Renaming**: If a metric is renamed, update the table entry. Mark the old name as deprecated and include a reference to the new name.

3. **Metric Removal**: If a metric is no longer used, don't delete its entry. Instead, mark it as deprecated in the table and provide a brief explanation.

4. **Code Location Changes**: If the placement of a metric in the code changes, update the "Start time" and "End time" columns to reflect the new location.
