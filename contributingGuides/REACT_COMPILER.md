# React Compiler

## What is the React Compiler?

[React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) is a tool designed to enhance the performance of React applications by automatically memoizing components that lack optimizations.

At Expensify, we are early adopters of this tool and aim to fully leverage its capabilities.

## React Compiler CI check

We have implemented a CI check that runs the React Compiler on all pull requests (PRs). This check compares compilable files from the PR branch with those in the target branch. If it detects that a file was previously compiled successfully but now fails to compile, the check will fail.

## What if CI check fails in my PR?

If the CI check fails for your PR, you need to fix the problem. If you're unsure how to resolve it, you can ask for help in the `#expensify-open-source` Slack channel (and tag `@Kiryl Ziusko`).

## How can I check what exactly prevents file from successful optimization or whether my fix for passing `react-compiler` actually works?

You can run `npm run react-compiler-healthcheck` and examine the output. This command will list the files that failed to compile and provide details on what caused the failures. The output can be extensive, so you may want to write it to a file for easier review:

```bash
npm run react-compiler-healthcheck &> output.txt
```

## How to fix a particular problem?

Below are the most common failures and approaches to fix them:

### New `ref` produces `Mutating a value returned from a function whose return value should not be mutated`

If you encounter this error, you need to add the `Ref` postfix to the variable name. For example:

```diff
-const rerender = useRef();
+const rerenderRef = useRef()
```

### New `SharedValue` produces `Mutating a value returned from a function whose return value should not be mutated`

If you added a modification to `SharedValue`, you'll likely encounter this error. You can ignore this error for now because the current `react-native-reanimated` API is not compatible with `react-compiler` rules. Once [this PR](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-reanimated/pull/6312) is merged, we'll rewrite the code to be compatible with `react-compiler`. Until then, you can ignore this error.

### `manual memoization could not be preserved`

This error usually occurs when a dependency used inside a hook is omitted. This omission creates a memoization that is too complex to optimize automatically. Try including the missing dependencies.

Please be aware that `react-compiler` struggles with memoization of nested fields, i. e.:

```ts
// ❌ such code triggers the error
const selectedQboAccountName = useMemo(() => qboAccountOptions?.find(({id}) => id === qboConfig?.reimbursementAccountID)?.name, [qboAccountOptions, qboConfig?.reimbursementAccountID]);

// ✅ this code can be compiled successfully
const reimbursementAccountID = qboConfig?.reimbursementAccountID;
const selectedQboAccountName = useMemo(() => qboAccountOptions?.find(({id}) => id === reimbursementAccountID)?.name, [qboAccountOptions, reimbursementAccountID]);
// 👍 also new version of the code creates a variable for a repeated code
// which is great because it reduces the amount of the duplicated code
```

### `Invalid nesting in program blocks or scopes`

Such error may happen if we have a nested memoization, i. e.:

```tsx
const qboToggleSettingItems = [
    {
        onToggle: () => console.log('Hello world!'),
        subscribedSetting: CONST.QUICKBOOKS_CONFIG.ENABLED,
    },
];

return (
  <Container>
    {qboToggleSettingItems.map((item) => (
        <ToggleSettingOptionRow
            onToggle={item.onToggle}
            // ❌ such code triggers the error - `qboConfig?.pendingFields` is an external variable from the closure
            // so this code is pretty complicated for `react-compiler` optimizations 
            pendingAction={settingsPendingAction([item.subscribedSetting], qboConfig?.pendingFields)}
            // ❌ such code triggers the error - `qboConfig` is an external variable from the closure
            errors={ErrorUtils.getLatestErrorField(qboConfig, item.subscribedSetting)}
        />
    ))}
  </Container>
)
```

And below is a corrected version of the code:

```tsx
const qboToggleSettingItems = [
    {
        onToggle: () => console.log('Hello world!'),
        subscribedSetting: CONST.QUICKBOOKS_CONFIG.ENABLED,
        // 👇 calculate variables and memoize `qboToggleSettingItems` object (done by `react-compiler`)
        errors: ErrorUtils.getLatestErrorField(qboConfig, CONST.QUICKBOOKS_CONFIG.ENABLED),
        pendingAction: settingsPendingAction([CONST.QUICKBOOKS_CONFIG.ENABLED], qboConfig?.pendingFields),
    },
];

return (
  <Container>
    {qboToggleSettingItems.map((item) => (
        <ToggleSettingOptionRow
            onToggle={item.onToggle}
            // ✅ we depend only on `qboToggleSettingItems`, no more complex closures, so everything is fine
            pendingAction={item.pendingAction}
            // ✅ we depend only on `qboToggleSettingItems`, no more complex closures, so everything is fine
            errors={item.errors}
        />
    ))}
  </Container>
)
```

### `Unexpected terminal kind optional for ternary test block`

The problem happens when you have a ternary operator and you are using optional chaining `?.` operator:

```tsx
<OfflineWithFeedback
  description={menuItem.description}
  // ❌ such code triggers the error
  brickRoadIndicator={PolicyUtils.areSettingsInErrorFields(menuItem?.subscribedSettings, qboConfig?.errorFields) ? CONST.ERROR : undefined}
>
</OfflineWithFeedback>
```

In this case, `qboConfig?.errorFields` is causing the error, and the solution is to put it outside the ternary test block:

```tsx
// 👇 move optional field outside of a ternary block
const errorFields = qboConfig?.errorFields;

...

<OfflineWithFeedback
    description={menuItem.description}
    // ✅ this code can be compiled successfully now
    brickRoadIndicator={PolicyUtils.areSettingsInErrorFields(menuItem?.subscribedSettings, errorFields) ? CONST.ERROR : undefined}
>
</OfflineWithFeedback>
```
