Contributors are eligible to be paid via Expensify 18 months after they were assigned to their first GitHub issue. Around this time an Expensify employee should email the eligible contributor if they’re active and have completed 5 or more jobs. If it’s been two weeks after your eligibility date and you haven’t received an email, please contact [contributors@expensify.com](mailto:contributors@expensify.com?subject=Request%20to%20be%20added%20to%20Expensify%20Payments&body=-%20GitHub%20handle%20%3D%20%0A-%20Legal%20name%20%3D%20%0A-%20Link%20to%20first%20issue%20you%20were%20assigned%20to%20%3D) with the subject “Request to be added to Expensify Payments”.  Please include your GitHub handle, legal name and a link to the first issue you were assigned to. When the employee replies to initiate setup they will ask for a [W9](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) (US) or [W8-BEN](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-8-ben).

## Global Reimbursement Details
- You’ll need to create an Expensify account and Connect Personal Bank Account. To receive payments in USD, GBP, or EUR, add receiving accounts in those currencies via platforms like Wise, Payoneer, PingPong, Skydo, etc. 
  - Payoneer provides a U.S.-based USD account through Citibank. Since you won’t have direct access to a Citibank online account, you’ll need to connect the bank account manually instead of using Plaid. 
    - You can do this in **oldDot** by navigating to: Settings > Account > Wallet > Add Personal Bank Account > Connect manually.
  - Skydo is a service that contributors in India have used. 
- View [Enable Global Reimbursement](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/payments/Enable-Global-Reimbursement) to get more details on setting up reimbursements in United States (USD), Canada (CAD), United Kingdom (GBP), European Union (EUR), Australia (AUD) and Singapore (SGD) currencies.
- View [Receive Payments](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/payments/Receive-Payments) for details on receiving payments in the US and internationally, including via Wise (formerly TransferWise), Paypal, Venmo and more.  

After approval it can take between 1 business day and a week, depending on the country and service you use.
