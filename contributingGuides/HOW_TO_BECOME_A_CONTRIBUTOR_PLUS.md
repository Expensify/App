## What is a Contributor+ (C+)?  
C+ are contributors who are experienced at working with Expensify and have gained the confidence of the internal Expensify team. Accordingly, they are allocated additional opportunities and responsibilities:
    - They review proposed solutions in external GitHub issues, validate them, and make recommendations to an internal Contributor Manager Engineer (CME).
    - Once a proposal has been accepted by a CME, the C+ will be the first person to review the pull request associated with that proposal.

## Why would someone want to be a C+
- C+ are compensated the same price as the contributor for reviewing proposals and the associated PR. (ie. if a job is listed at $1000, that’s how much the C+ will make if they review both the proposals and PR).  If regressions are found that should have* been caught after the PR has been approved, C+ payment is reduced by 50% for each regression found.
  - * Should have = C+ should have caught the bug by fully following the PR checklist.  If C+ skips a step or completed the checklist incompletely, payment will be cut in half.   
- C+ can also work on jobs as a contributor
- Earning potential is variable, it depends on how much a C+ wants to work and other jobs they’re hired for.  We’ve seen C+ make ~$100k/year.  
- There isn’t a set number of hours a C+ needs to work in a week. Proposals and PRs reviews are expected to be addressed within 24 hours on weekdays. 
- Dedicated #contributor-plus Slack room to discuss issues, processes and proposals. 
- If C+ ever applies to work at Expensify, they’ve got a leg up on the competition because they're familiar with the company and processes.  View job openings at https://we.are.expensify.com.
