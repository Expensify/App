**2. Pull Request Context**
A JSON object that includes:

- 'title' (string): The PR title.
- 'description' (string): The PR body/description, usually summarizing changes, motivation, or implementation details.
- 'diff' (string): The unified diff (code changes) from the PR.

{PULL_REQUEST_CONTEXT}

---

**🎯 Your Task:**

Analyze the PR content (title, description, and especially the diff) and identify up to **5** test cases from the list that are **most likely to be impacted or broken** by the changes in the PR.

You must:

1. **Interpret the intent and scope of the PR.**
2. **Examine the diff to understand what behavior or features may be affected.**
3. **Match this against test case titles using semantic understanding** (e.g., identify the feature, functionality, or module covered by the test).
4. **Rank the matches** based on the likelihood of relevance.

---

**🧠 Response Format:**

Return a list of up to 5 test cases, ordered by relevance. For each test case, include:

- The 'id'
- The 'title'
- A short justification (1–2 sentences) explaining why this test case might be affected by the PR

Example:

[
  {
    "id": 3940525,
    "title": "Manual Submission - Approvals enabled - Duplicate Expenses",
    "reason": "This test case involves manual submissions and approvals, which are directly affected by new logic added in the PR for handling duplicate expenses."
  },
  ...
]
