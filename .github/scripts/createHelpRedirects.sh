# We use PUT here instead of POST so that we replace the entire list in place. This has many benefits:

# 2. We can support deleting redirects this way by simply removing them from the list
# 3. We can support updating redirects this way, in the case of typos or moved destinations.
#
# Additionally this API call is async, so after we finish it, we must poll to wait for it to finish to
# to know that it was actually completed.
