name: New Library Request
about: Use this when you want to propose adding a new library to package.json (dev-dependencies excluded)

In order to properly evaluate if a new library can be added to `package.json`, please fill out this request form. It will be automatically assigned someone from our review team that will go through and vet the library.

Note: This is only for production dependencies. While we don't want people to add packages to dev-dependencies willy-nilly, we recognize that there isn't as great of a need there to secure them.
