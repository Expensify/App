            If you applied the `CP Staging` label before the PR was merged, the PR will be be immediately deployed to staging even if the [open `StagingDeployCash` deploy checklist](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AStagingDeployCash) is locked.
            However if you applied the `CP Staging` after the PR was merged it's possible it won't be CP'ed automatically. If you need it to be CP'ed to staging, tag a member of @Expensify/mobile-deployers to CP it manually, otherwise you can wait for it to go out with the next deploy.
