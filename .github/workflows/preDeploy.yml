            I know there's a lot of information in our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md), so here are some points to take note of :memo::

            1. Now that your first PR has been merged, you can be hired for another issue. Once you've completed a few issues, you may be eligible to work on more than one job at a time.
            2. Once your PR is deployed to our staging servers, it will undergo quality assurance (QA) testing. If we find that it doesn't work as expected or causes a regression, you'll be responsible for fixing it. Typically, we would revert this PR and give you another chance to create a similar PR without causing a regression.
            3. Once your PR is deployed to _production_, we start a 7-day timer :alarm_clock:. After it has been on production for 7 days without causing any regressions, then we pay out the Upwork job. :moneybag:

            So it might take a while before you're paid for your work, but we typically post multiple new jobs every day, so there's plenty of opportunity. I hope you've had a positive experience contributing to this repo! :blush:
