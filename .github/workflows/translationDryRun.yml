  # We always run dry-run the script to verify that it still works.
  # The generateTranslations script runs with ts-node, which can't handle Flow
  # (the specialized JS that React Native is written in).
  # Therefore, adding an import in the wrong place could break the script, even if you didn't modify the script.
