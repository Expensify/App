          #  - comm is used to get the intersection between two bash arrays
          #    - git diff is used to see the files that were added on this branch
          #    - gh pr view is used to list files touched by this PR. Git diff may give false positives if the branch isn't up-to-date with main
          #  - wc counts the words in the result of the intersection
