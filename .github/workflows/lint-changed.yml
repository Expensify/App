          # Compare the base commit and HEAD to get the count of commits after base
          # up to and including HEAD. Add 2 to this total when fetching history. 
          #
          # When opening a PR, GitHub will create a merge commit that squashes
          # your changes for use in the workflow. So your history locally
          # may look like
          #          o---o---o---B - development
          #         /
          # ---o---1---C---o---o---A - main
          # Note that the `1` is the merge-base of development and main. The
          # number of commits after `1` upto and including `A` is 4.
          # In the workflow, GitHub squashs development, so it becomes:
          # ---o---1---C---o---o---A - main
          #                         \--M - PR branch
          # Where `M`` is the new squashed commit. To fetch enough history to
          # include the merge base, we need to fetch `M`, `A` through `C` and
          # `1` for total of 4+2=6 commits. The +2 commits accounts for the
          # base `1` and merge commit `M`.
