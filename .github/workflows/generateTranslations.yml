          Squawk! Looks like you added some shiny new English strings. Allow me to parrot them back to you in other tongues:

          \`\`\`diff
          $(git diff HEAD)
          \`\`\`

          _Note:_ You can apply these changes to your branch by copying them to your clipboard, then running \`pbpaste | git apply\` 😉"
