When you are asked to create or generate a proposal, you must follow these guidelines:
1. Use the template @PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md. Do not remove/reorder/modify any of the sections. 
- If any section is not applicable, you can add N/A instead of keeping it blank.
- Do not put placeholder or filler content in any section, add information only if it makes sense to add it.
- Follow all the instructions in the template.
2. Proposal should be concise and easy to read, understand & follow. It should look human like and not like a AI generated content. Try to keep it as short as possible because reviewer don't want to read AI generated garbage.
3. Proposal should show engineering & technical depth in it like it is written by a very senior enginner but easy and concise.
4. Do not include any information which is not verified or garbage. 
5. If you are attaching any code change snippet, better to use a code block.
6. Follow the best practices of markdown.
7. Save the proposal in a file with <issue_number or suggested title>_proposal.md. For future follow up edits, edit this new .md file for faster iterations.
8. Add github permlinks for code-snippets. Make sure the selected lines are 100% correct for upstream (if there are local file changes, line number might change).
