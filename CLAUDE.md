# Expensify App

## Repository Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Native
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Native Onyx
- **Navigation**: React Navigation
- **Platforms**: iOS, Android, Web, Desktop (Electron)

## HybridApp Architecture (Critical Context)

**IMPORTANT**: The mobile application is built from the Mobile-Expensify submodule, not directly from the App repository.
**IMPORTANT**: NewDot refers to the new Expensify App, OldDot or Expensify Classic refers to our Old expensify app and website

### Key Integration Points
- App (NewDot) and Mobile-Expensify (OldDot) are combined into a single mobile application
- The HybridApp module (`@expensify/react-native-hybrid-app`) manages transitions between OldDot and NewDot
- Build process merges dotenv configurations from both repositories
- Environment variables from Mobile-Expensify take precedence over App variables
- Mobile builds **must** be initiated from the Mobile-Expensify directory

### Build Modes
- **Standalone**: Pure NewDot application (web/desktop)
- **HybridApp**: Combined OldDot + NewDot (mobile apps)
- Controlled via `STANDALONE_NEW_DOT` environment variable

## Core Architecture & Structure

## Related Repositories

### Mobile-Expensify (Submodule)
- **Path**: `App/Mobile-Expensify/`
- **Purpose**: Legacy OldDot application and mobile build source
- **Critical**: All mobile builds originate from this directory
- Contains platform-specific code for iOS and Android
- Manages the HybridApp integration layer

### expensify-common
- **Purpose**: Shared libraries and utilities
- Contains common validation, parsing, and utility functions
- Used across multiple Expensify repositories

## Development Practices

### Code Quality
