# Expensify Code of Conduct

## Overview of Expensify
At Expensify, our unique approach to solving a real-world problem allows people to
spend less time managing expenses and more time pursuing their real goals. Today,
millions of people use Expensify across the globe — more than the rest of the industry
combined. We’re the fastest-growing receipt and expense company globally, and one of
the highest revenue-per-employee companies in the world. We reimburse millions of
dollars every day, process billions every year, and serve customers in more than 169
countries.

We pride ourselves as a company and as individual employees on our core qualities:
Talent, Ambition, & Humility. The environment we have developed uses these qualities
to adhere to our two golden rules of Expensify:


- Get Shit Done
- Don’t Ruin it for Everyone Else

We view our partnerships with contributors as an extension of Expensify and
representative of our company and values. To maintain fairness and promote the safety
of this extended Expensify, at a minimum, we expect our contributors to comply with the
letter and spirit of all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which they
operate. Furthermore, we expect that any failure to adhere to the
principles set out in this Contributor Code of Conduct can result in an immediate termination of your participation in the Expensify Contributor Community.

## Inclusiveness
At Expensify, we are a diverse group of people, with employees of different races,
ethnicities, nationalities, ages, gender identities, sexual orientations, and more. This
diversity is important -- it expands our worldview, increases our empathy, feeds our
creativity, and is a key component in our continued success. In order to nurture and
expand our diversity, it is imperative that we maintain an inclusive environment for
everyone here. One of the ways that we do that is by ensuring that we never turn a blind
eye towards discrimination. We expect the contributors we work with to do the same.
We value everyone’s right to freedom of thought and freedom of speech. Everyone is
encouraged to make their own decisions about what to believe and how to live.
However, when working on Expensify sponsored projects, or any time your actions could reflect on our company, we expect everyone to act in an inclusive manner.

It’s possible to be unintentionally offensive. Everyone has some unconscious biases. No
one is expected to be perfect or to know everything. However, we draw a clear line as a
company when:

There is intentional discrimination against anyone. Bases of discrimination include but are not limited to age, sex, race, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, religion, and disability; 
- Encouraging discrimination, even if the discrimination being encouraged is
outside of Expensify, or if no actual discrimination occurs; and/or
- Celebrating discrimination, whether the discrimination being celebrated is real or theoretical. 

While it certainly takes more than the above to create an inclusive environment, this is
our minimum expectation for every contributor. We encourage everyone to be curious while simultaneously being respectful of our differences. Building an inclusive environment requires clear communication, checking for understanding, taking note of non-verbal communication and being aware of our own assumptions. The best interactions occur when there is a baseline understanding that everyone is equal and all people are individuals with unique experiences.

Acting inclusively is of equal importance when we are interacting with colleagues as it is
when we are interacting with others. Diversity of thought is one of our strengths, so let’s all do our part to protect it.
