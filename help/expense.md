### Bank Account Requirements
#### [Business Bank Account Requirements] What are the general requirements for adding a business bank account?
To add a business bank account to issue reimbursements via ACH (US) or to issue Expensify Cards:
- Enter a physical address for yourself, any Beneficial Owner (if one exists), and the business associated with the bank account. We cannot accept a PO Box or MailDrop location.
- We are required by law to verify your identity. Part of this process requires you to verify a US-issued photo ID. Your ID must be issued by the United States to use features related to US ACH. You and any Beneficial Owner (if one exists) must also have a US address.

#### [Beneficial Owner Definition] What is a Beneficial Owner?
A Beneficial Owner refers to an **individual** who owns 25% or more of the business. If no individual owns 25% or more of the business, the company does not have a Beneficial Owner.

#### [Beneficial Owner Details] What do I do if the Beneficial Owner section only asks for personal details, but my organization is owned by another company?
Please indicate you have a Beneficial Owner only if it is an individual who owns 25% or more of the business.

#### [Address and ID Verification] Why can’t I input my address or upload my ID?
When adding a verified business bank account in Expensify, the individual adding the account and any beneficial owner (if one exists) are required to have a US address, US photo ID, and a US SSN. If you do not meet these requirements, you’ll need to have another admin add the bank account and then share access with you once it is verified.

#### [Document Requests] Why am I asked for documents when adding my bank account?
When a bank account is added to Expensify, we complete a series of checks to verify the information provided to us. We conduct these checks to comply with both our sponsor bank's requirements and federal government regulations, specifically the Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering (BSA / AML) laws. Expensify also has anti-fraud measures in place.

If automatic verification fails, we may request manual verification, which could involve documents such as address verification for your business, a letter from your bank confirming bank account ownership, etc.

If you have any questions regarding the documentation request you received, please contact Concierge and they will be happy to assist.

### Bank Account Validation
#### [Microtransaction Validation] I don’t see all three microtransactions I need to validate my bank account. What should I do?
Wait until the end of the second business day. If you still don’t see them, please contact your bank and ask them to whitelist our ACH IDs **1270239450**, **4270239450**, and **2270239450**. Expensify’s ACH Originator Name is "Expensify."

Once that's all set, make sure to contact your account manager or concierge, and our team will be able to re-trigger those three test transactions!

#### [Test Deposits for Validation] How many test deposits will I receive when validating my business bank account?
You will receive two withdrawals and one deposit in your business bank account to complete the validation process.

#### [Missing Test Deposits] What should I do if I don't see the test deposits in my business bank account after two business days?
If the test deposits are not visible after two business days, it may be due to direct debits not being enabled on your bank account. In such cases, provide your bank with the following details:
- ACH CompanyIDs: 1270239450, 4270239450, 2270239450
