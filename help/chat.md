* **Chat rooms** - Public or private discussions available to workspace members.

### Special Chat Rooms
Expensify Chat includes special chat rooms for specific purposes:

#### Admin and Announce
Special rooms in a workspace:

* **#admins** - Only accessible to Workspace Admins to manage settings and collaborate with other admins. This room includes your Expensify Setup Specialist and, if applicable, your Account Manager. You can also:
  - Chat with your dedicated Expensify Setup Specialist.
  - Chat with your Account Manager (if you have a subscription with 10 or more members).
  - Review changes made to your Workspace settings.

* **#announce** - For company-wide announcements. By default, all Workspace Members can send messages, but permissions can be updated to allow only admins to post.

### Update Messaging Permissions in #announce
To allow only admins to post in an #announce room:

1. Open the #announce room chat in your inbox.
2. Press the room header.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Choose **Who can post** and select **Admins only**.

### Reorder Chat Inbox

Customize the order of chat messages in your inbox by pinning them or changing your message priority:

* **Pin**: Moves a specific chat to the top of your inbox list.
* **Message priority**: Determines the order of message display:
  - **Most Recent**: Shows all chats by the most recent, with pinned chats at the top.
  - **#focus**: Displays only unread and pinned chats, sorted alphabetically.

#### Pin a Message

To pin a message:

1. Press and hold (or right-click) a chat in your inbox.
2. Select **Pin**. The chat will be pinned to the top of your inbox.
3. To unpin, repeat this process and select the pin icon again.

#### Change Message Priority

To change message priority:

1. Press your profile image or icon.
2. Select the **Preferences** tab.
3. Choose **Priority Mode** and select either #focus or Most Recent.

### Leave a Chat Room

To leave a chat room:

1. Open the chat room.
2. Press the header or the 3 dot menu icon in the top right.
3. Select **Leave**. After leaving, the chat room will no longer appear in your inbox, and you won't receive notifications from it.

### Flag Chat Messages

Flagging a message as offensive (including unwanted behavior or offensive messages or attachments) escalates it to Expensify’s internal moderation team for review. The person who sent the message will be notified of the flag anonymously, and the moderation team will decide what further action is needed.

Depending on the severity of the offense, messages can be hidden (with an option to reveal) or fully removed. In extreme cases, the sender of the message may be temporarily or permanently blocked from posting.

Messages sent in public chat rooms are automatically reviewed for offensive content by an automated system. If offensive content is found, the message is sent to Expensify’s internal moderation team for further review.

To flag a message:

1. Open the chat in your inbox.
2. Press and hold (or hover over on desktop) the message and select **Flag as offensive**.
3. Select a category: spam, inconsiderate, intimidation, bullying, harassment, or assault.
