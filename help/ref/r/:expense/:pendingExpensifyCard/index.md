# Expensify Card (pending)

A "pending" Expensify Card expense represents a purchase that was recently made on the card, but has not yet "posted" â€“ meaning, it has not been formally recognized as a final, complete transaction.

Any changes made to this expense will be preserved when the expense posts, typically 2-7 days later.

Pending transactions cannot be approved, as the final expense amount will not be confirmed until it posts.
