# Expense

Every expense gets a dedicated chat to discuss that specific expense. The expense consists of:

- **Receipt** – Attach a photo or document to this expense.
- **Amount** – The financial total of this transaction.
- **Description** – A general explanation of what this expense was for.
- **Merchant** – The business this purchase was made at.
- **Date** – The day on which the purchase was made.

The expense chat is shared with everyone in the approval flow, and will maintain an audit trail of all historical changes.
