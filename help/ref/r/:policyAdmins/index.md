# #admins

Every workspace automatically receives a special `#admins` chat room. Every admin is automatically added to this room as a member. The `#admins` room is used for several purposes:

- **Talking with Concierge, your setup specialist, or your account manager** – When you first create the workspace, Concierge and a setup specialist will be added. Feel free to ask any setup questions you have about how to configure the workspace, onboard your team, connect your accounting, or anything else you might need.

- **Monitoring workspace changes** – Every `#admins` room shows an audit trail of any configuration changes or significant events happening inside the workspace.

- **Chatting with other admins** – The `#admins` room is a useful space for workspace admins to chat with each other about anything, whether or not it relates to Expensify.
