# Inbox

The Inbox is a prioritized "to do" list, highlighting exactly what you need to do next. It consists of:

## Priorities

At the top of the Inbox are the most important tasks you should do first, which include:

- Expense reports waiting on you  
- Tasks assigned to you  
- Chats that have mentioned you  
- Anything you have pinned

## Chats

Beneath the priorities are a list of chats (with unread chats highlighted in bold), in one of two view modes:

- **Most Recent** – Lists every chat, ordered by whichever was most recently active.  
- **Focus** – Only lists chats with unread messages, sorted alphabetically.
