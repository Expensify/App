# Expense Report

Every expense report gets a dedicated chat to discuss expenses, approvals, or anything you like. The expense report chat:

- Is shared with everyone in the approval flow configured inside the workspace.
- Will maintain an audit trail of all historical workflow actions (i.e., approvals).

Press the attach button to add more expenses, or press the header for more options. Press on any expense to go deeper.
