# Announce Room (#announce) 

The #announce room is a chat space available to all workspace members. It's perfect for sharing company-wide updates, policy changes, or event reminders. The #announce room is accessible from your **Inbox** in the left-hand menu. 

- **Post company-wide announcements:** All members can post in #announce by default, making it easy to communicate across the workspace.

- **Restrict posting to admins:** Workspace admins can limit posting to admins only. Open the #announce room, click the room header, select Settings, and change Who can post to Admins only.

- **Everyone can read messages:** Even if posting is limited to admins, all workspace members can still view messages in the #announce room.
