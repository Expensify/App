# Workspaces 101

Think of a workspace as mission control for your company’s expenses. It’s where you set the rules, invite the team, and connect to your accounting tools. Each workspace runs independently, so you can keep things tidy across departments, entities, or clients.

## Create a new workspace
Hit the **New workspace** button to get started. Add a name, set a default currency, and you’re ready to get started customizing the workspace settings!

## Invite your team
Add teammates to your workspace to manage expenses and approvals in one central place:
- Members can submit and approve reports they’re assigned to.
- Admins can approve all reports and manage workspace settings.

## Automate approvals
Toggle on **Add Approvals** under **Workflows** to set a default first approver. Create custom approval flows for individual team members if needed.

## Connect your accounting system
Link your workspace with QuickBooks Online, Xero, NetSuite, or Sage Intacct to sync expenses like a pro.

## Enhance your workspace with extra features
Under **More Features**, enable extras like the Expensify Card, distance rates, custom categories and tags, and company card connections.

**Tip:** If you manage multiple departments, clients, or entities, consider creating multiple workspaces. Separate workspaces can help keep settings, approvals, and payments organized and more automated.
