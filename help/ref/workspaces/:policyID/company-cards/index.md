# Company Cards

Already have business credit cards? You can connect them to Expensify to automatically pull in transactions. Most major banks and card providers are supported.

---

- **How to connect cards**: Link your corporate card program to your workspace, assign the cards to the corresponding cardholder, and transactions will start syncing automatically as they post—no manual entry needed.

- **Exporting expenses**: Send card transactions to your accounting system, either to a shared account or separate ones for each cardholder.

- **eReceipts**: Turn on eReceipts to automatically generate digital receipts for USD transactions under $75—no more chasing paper ones.
