# Workspace Rules

Rules help you stick to your expense policy without micromanaging. Set limits, require receipts, and automate approvals. Expensify checks every expense against your rules and flags anything that’s off. 

**Note:** Workspace rules are only available on the Control plan.

---

- **Expense requirements:** Decide when receipts are required, set a max spend per expense, and control how far back expenses can be submitted.

- **Prohibited expenses:** Let Expensify’s AI catch restricted items like alcohol, gambling, or tobacco—no manual review needed.

- **Automatic approvals:** Save time by auto-approving compliant reports under a certain amount. You can even randomly audit a few to keep everyone honest.
