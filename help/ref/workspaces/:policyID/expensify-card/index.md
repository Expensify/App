# Expensify Card

The Expensify Card is a smart company card with real-time controls and built-in cash back. It allows you to issue unlimited virtual cards, set custom limits for each employee, and manage everything in one place. 

**Note:** You’ll need a connected US business bank account to get started.

- **Issue cards**: Hand out virtual or physical cards with flexible spending controls, such as smart limits, monthly caps, or fixed amounts.

- **Smarter spending controls**: Set custom limits, block certain merchant types, and track every swipe in real time.

- **Easy card management**: As a workspace admin, you can see all issued cards at a glance. You can adjust limits, rename cards, or deactivate them whenever you need to.
