# Tax Settings

Track VAT, GST, or any other regional taxes right in Expensify. Perfect for staying compliant—especially if you're working in non-USD currencies. You can set up different tax rates for your workspace currency and for foreign currencies, too.

---

- **How to set up tax rates**: Click the green + button to add a tax rate. Just enter the tax name, percentage, and tax code for your records.

- **Default tax settings**: Set separate default rates for your workspace currency and foreign currencies, so everything’s accurate no matter where you’re spending.

- **Managing tax rates**: You can turn rates on or off, update their values, or delete them entirely. Use bulk actions to move faster, or make changes one at a time.
