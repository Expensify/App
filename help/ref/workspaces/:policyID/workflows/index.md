# Workflows

Setting up workflows on your workspace automates how expenses move from submission to payment. They keep things organized and help you control when expenses are submitted, who approves them, and how they get paid. 

**Note:** Only admins can configure workspace workflows.

---

- **Approval setup**: Assign approvers to review expenses before theyâ€™re paid. You can even customize approvers for different team members.

- **Submission timing**: Pick a daily or weekly schedule for automatic expense submission so no one forgets to submit their expenses. 

- **Automated payments**: Link your business bank account, and Expensify will automatically process payments for approved expenses and invoices.
