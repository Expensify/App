# Distance Rates

Distance rates make it easy to pay employees when they use their personal vehicles for work. You can set different rates for different vehicle types or travel situations. Just make sure at least one rate is active when this feature is turned on.

- **How to set up rates**: Under **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Distance rates** and choose **Add rate**. Enter how much you’ll reimburse per mile or kilometer and click **Save**.

- **Multiple rate options**: Customize rates for personal cars, company vehicles, or different types of trips. 

- **Managing your rates**: To save time, you can turn rates on or off, update amounts, or manage them in bulk.
