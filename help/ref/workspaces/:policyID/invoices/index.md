# Create and Send Invoices

Send invoices, track their status, and get paid — even if your customer isn't on Expensify. Invoicing comes included with all Expensify subscriptions.

- **Set Up Invoicing:** Add a business bank account to start sending and receiving invoice payments.

- **Invoice Balance:** Right up top, you’ll see your current invoice balance — that’s the money you’ve collected from paid invoices. If you’ve added a bank account, this balance will transfer automatically.

- **Customize Your Invoices:** Make your invoices your own. Add your company name, website, and logo — they’ll show up on every invoice you send.
