# Accounting Integrations

Link your workspace directly to your accounting system to make expense tracking smarter and smoother. We’ll automatically sync your chart of accounts so your team can code expenses accurately — and approved reports flow right back into your books. Less manual work, more peace of mind.

**Once connected, you can fine-tune your setup with:**
- Import settings to control what data comes from your accounting system.
- Export settings to choose how expense reports are sent back.
- Advanced options for automation, such as auto-sync and employee settings.
