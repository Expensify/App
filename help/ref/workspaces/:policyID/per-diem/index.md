# Per Diem Settings

Per diem makes it easy to cover travel or recurring allowances with fixed daily rates—no need to track every coffee or cab ride. Employees just pick a rate and submit. You can create rates manually or import them from a spreadsheet.

---

- **Set up rates**: Create daily rates for different locations, meal types, or travel needs. Just enter the amount, and you're done!

- **Default categories**: Assign a default category to keep all your per diem expenses organized and your accounting on track.
