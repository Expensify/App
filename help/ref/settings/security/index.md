# Security

This is where you control who can access your account and how secure it is. From adding two-factor authentication to merging accounts, it’s all in one spot.

---

## Two-Factor Authentication

This adds an extra layer of protection to your Expensify account. Even if someone gets your login info, they won’t be able to access it without a code from your authenticator app.

- **Set it up in a minute:** Use an app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator to link your account.

- **Don’t skip the backup codes:** Download or save your recovery codes somewhere safe. You’ll need them if you ever lose access to your app.

- **How login works:** You’ll log in with your email magic code and a 6-digit code from your authenticator app.

## Merge Accounts

If you've ended up with two Expensify accounts, you can merge them to keep expense history and workspace access under a single login.

- **Heads up:** Merging is permanent and must be done from your company account by pulling in the personal one.

- **How to merge:** Under **Account > Security > Merge accounts**, add the email address of the account you’re merging and then enter the magic code sent to your email. 

- **What moves over:** Expenses, reports, cards, co-pilots — everything from the merged account rolls over into your existing account.

## Report Suspicious Activity

If something feels off or you're concerned a bad actor has gained access to your account, report it by clicking **Report suspicious activity**. This will fully lock down your account and halt Expensify Card transactions immediately.

## Close Account

If you need to close your Expensify account, you can do that here — there are just a few things to check off first.

- **Before you close:** Make sure to transfer ownerships, clear any balances, and update billing contacts.

- **After closing the account:** Shared reports and expenses will still be accessible to workspace admins, but all your personal data will be wiped.
