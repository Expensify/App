# Subscription Plan

Your subscription plan determines which features are available and how much you're charged per active member. Choose the one that fits your teamâ€™s needs and budget!

---

- **Expensify offers two plans -- Collect and Control:** The Collect plan is $5 per member each month. The Control plan ranges from $9 to $36 per member/month, depending on your subscription commitment and how much your team uses the Expensify Card.

- **Add a payment card:** To pay for your subscription, add a payment card under **Account > Subscription**. Charges will automatically be billed to this card each month.

- **Change plan:** You can switch plans by clicking **Explore all plans**. You can upgrade your plan or increase your subscription size at any time. 

- **Request Tax-Exempt Status:** Under **Account > Subscription > Subscription settings**, click **Tax exempt status**. This kicks off a chat with Concierge, where you can request that your account be tax-exempt and then upload a PDF of your exemption document. Our team will review everything and reach out if we need anything else.
