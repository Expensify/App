# Workspace Workflows

Automate expense submission, approval, and reimbursement to streamline your team's expense management process.

## Make or Track Payments

**Purpose:** Reimburse employees and pay vendors directly from Expensify using your business bank account.

**How it works:** Connect your bank account to enable direct ACH transfers, vendor payments, and Expensify Card issuance.

**To set up:**
1. Go to **Workflows** > Toggle on **Make or Track Payments**
2. Click **Connect Bank Account** and complete setup
3. Choose an authorized expense payer

## Add Approvals

**Purpose:** Require expenses to be reviewed and approved before payment authorization.

**How it works:** Set default approvers for all members, or create custom approval workflows for specific team members. Supports multi-level approval chains.

**To set up:**
1. Go to **Workflows** > Toggle on **Add Approvals**
2. Set default approver (Workspace Owner by default)
3. Create custom workflows for specific members if needed

## Delay Submissions

**Purpose:** Control when expenses are automatically submitted to reduce administrative overhead.

**How it works:** Instead of instant submission, expenses are batched and submitted on your chosen schedule (daily, weekly, or monthly). Only error-free expenses are auto-submitted.

**To set up:**
1. Go to **Workflows** > Toggle on **Delay Submissions**
2. Choose submission frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)

## How Features Work Together

**Approvals + Delayed Submissions:** Expenses follow **Open** → **Processing** → **Approved**

**Approvals Only:** Expenses follow **Processing** → **Approved**

**All Features Enabled:** Expenses are batched, then approved, then automatically reimbursed
