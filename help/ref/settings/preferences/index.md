# Preferences

Your preferences shape how Expensify looks and feels just for you. Customize your language, theme, and notification settings to customize your experience across all your devices.

---

- **Notifications**: Decide which alerts you want to receive, such as feature updates, news, or sound notifications. Youâ€™re in control.

- **Priority mode:** Choose how chats appear in your inbox -- Focus on unread and pinned chats, or keep everything visible, with the most recent messages shown at the top of the left-hand menu.

- **Language options**: You can update your interface in just a few clicks by choosing from 10 supported languages. Choose your preferred language from the list, and your account will update automatically.

- **Payment Currency:** Set your default currency for expense tracking and reimbursements.

- **Theme:** Change the app's appearance to suit your preference:
     - **Dark Mode** - Easy on the eyes in low-light environments
     - **Light Mode** - Bright, clean interface for well-lit spaces
     - **Use Device Settings** - Automatically match your device's theme

**Note:** Preference changes only affect your personal account view. Workspace members must update their own settings individually.
