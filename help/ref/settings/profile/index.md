# Profile

Your profile is where you control how you show up in Expensify. Update your photo, name, status, and timezone so teammates know who they’re working with. Private info like your legal name and address stays visible to you only.

- **Setting your status**: Add a custom status (yep, emojis included) to show if you’re in a meeting, out of office, or just heads-down for a bit.

- **Managing contact methods**: Add backup emails or phone numbers to keep your account secure and accessible, even if your primary email changes.
