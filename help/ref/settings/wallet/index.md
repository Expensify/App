# Wallet

Your Wallet is the hub for all things money in Expensify. This is where you connect and manage your business and personal bank accounts, view company card details, and control how money moves in and out of your organization. Whether you're reimbursing employees, collecting payments, or issuing Expensify Cards, it all starts here.

## Business Bank Accounts
Connect a verified business bank account to unlock smart features like reimbursements, bill pay, invoice collection, and the Expensify Card.

- **Turn on payments:** Head to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > More features**, click **Enable workflows**, then toggle on **Make or track payments**. From there, hit **Connect bank account** to get started.

- **Connect your account:** Use Plaid to link your account in seconds, or enter your details manually. You’ll need to upload an ID, add your company info, and verify the account with a few test transactions.

- **Once your account is verified, you can:**
     - Reimburse employees via ACH
     - Pay vendors and suppliers
     - Issue Expensify Cards to your team
     - Collect invoice payments from clients

- **Share access to the bank account with another admin:** Under **Settings > Account > Wallet**, click **Share** next to the bank account, and enter the admin’s email. They’ll just need to revalidate the bank account on their end before they can issue payments.

## Personal Bank Accounts

If you want to get reimbursed or paid directly in Expensify, add a personal bank account — Expensify supports banks in over 190 countries.


- **Add your bank account**: Under **Settings > Wallet > Bank accounts**, click **Add bank account**, choose your country, and connect via Plaid or enter your info manually.

- **Note:** Personal bank accounts are for receiving funds only. You’ll need a verified business bank account to send payments or issue Expensify Cards.

## Assigned Cards

Company cards are assigned at the workspace level, but are visible to the individual cardholder in their **Wallet**. The cards sync automatically, so you can skip manually entering credit card expenses.

- **See card details (Expensify Card):** Click **Reveal details** to check your card number, expiration date, and security code for online purchases.

- **Track expenses smarter:** Transactions pull in automatically and match with SmartScanned receipts to keep records audit-ready.

- **View transactions:** Click on a connected card and then **View transactions** to see all of the imported expenses from that company card.
