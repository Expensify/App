# Tasks

Keep conversations organized by letting you create actionable to-dos directly within a chat. You can assign them to yourself or others in both 1:1 and group chats.

- **Create a task:** In any chat, click the + button next to the message field and select Assign a task. Add a title (required) and an optional description, and choose an assignee from chat participants. You can also leave it unassigned to track it yourself.

- **Use tasks to stay on top of action items:** Tasks are great for follow-ups like “Submit expense report,” “Share slide deck,” or “Update mileage rate.” They're perfect for 1:1 check-ins, project updates, or organizing next steps after a team discussion.

- **Edit and manage tasks:** Task creators and assignees can comment, edit the title or description, reassign the task, or mark it as complete. Just click the task to update any details.

- **Tasks stay visible:** Each task is shared in the chat where it's created. When completed, it will be clearly marked in the chat and can be reopened if needed.
