- You can control employee card usage by setting vendor and category restrictions. For example, you can restrict cards to be used only for travel-related purchases, or limit spending to certain vendors. These restrictions are enforced at the point of sale.

### Transaction Issues
#### Why did my transaction get declined?
- Here are some reasons why an Expensify Card transaction might be declined:
  - **Insufficient card limit**: If a transaction exceeds your Expensify Card’s available limit, the transaction will be declined. Submitting expenses and getting them approved will free up your limit for more spending.
  - **Inactive card**: Your card isn’t active yet or it was disabled by your Domain Admin.
  - **Incorrect card details**: Your card information was entered incorrectly with the merchant. Entering incorrect card information, such as the CVC, ZIP, or expiration date, will also lead to declines.
  - **Fraudulent or risky activity**: If Expensify detects unusual or suspicious activity, we may block transactions as a security measure.

### Expense Reporting
#### How do I report my Expensify Card expenses?
- You can report and submit Expensify Card expenses just like any other expenses, and you’ll want to submit them regularly to ensure you have a sufficient spending amount available on the card. As your expenses are approved, your Smart Limit updates accordingly.

- SmartScanned receipts should automatically attach to the related Expensify Card expense. Expensify also automatically generates an IRS-compliant eReceipt for every transaction as long as the expense isn’t lodging-related. If your organization doesn’t require itemized receipts, you can rely on eReceipts instead.

### Fraud Protection
#### How am I protected from fraud using the Expensify Card?
- Expensify uses sophisticated algorithms to detect and block unusual card activity. You can also enable real-time notifications to receive alerts each time your card is charged.

#### How long does the dispute process take?
- The dispute process can take up to 90 days.

#### Can I cancel a dispute?

- You can issue an unlimited number of both physical and virtual cards to employees, supporting a variety of use cases.

### Upgrading and Reconciliation

- There are several reasons why the task to accept new terms might not appear:
  - You may not be a Domain Admin.
  - Another domain admin has already accepted the terms.
  - The task might be hidden. Scroll to the bottom of the Home page and press **Show Hidden Tasks** to view all tasks.

#### Will upgrading affect the continuous reconciliation process?
- The upgrade process won't affect continuous reconciliation. During the transition, you may have employees with both old and new cards, resulting in two separate debits for your settlement account per period. Once all spending transitions to the new cards, you'll only see one settlement.

#### Do I have to upgrade to the new Expensify Visa® Commercial Card?
- Yes, an upgrade to the new Expensify Visa® Commercial Card is necessary. A deadline will be provided soon, but you'll have ample time to complete the upgrade.
