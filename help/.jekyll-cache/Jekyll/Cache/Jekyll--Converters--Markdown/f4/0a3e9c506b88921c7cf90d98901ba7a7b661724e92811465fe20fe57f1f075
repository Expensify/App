<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>SmartScan is the time-saving tool that every Expensify user needs. Using SmartScan, you can quickly upload receipts and walk away to take care of more important things. Behind the scenes, SmartScan will process the expense data from your receipt and create an expense or automatically attach the receipt to a matching imported credit card expense.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-smartscan">What is SmartScan?</h2>

<p>SmartScan is simple on the outside and complex on the inside. When you SmartScan a receipt, we‚Äôll read the <strong>Merchant</strong>, <strong>Date</strong> and <strong>Amount</strong> of the transaction, create an expense, and add it to your Expensify account automatically. If you have a credit card connected and you upload a receipt that matches a card expense, the SmartScanned receipt will automatically merge with the imported expense instead!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expensify accounts come with 25 free SmartScans per month. If you‚Äôre an individual user and you need access to unlimited SmartScans, check out the <strong><a href="https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5535/deep-dive-the-monthly-subscription-is-it-right-for-me">Monthly Subscription</a></strong>!</li>
  <li>If your organization is already using Expensify and you belong to a company policy, you‚Äôll have access to unlimited SmartScans by default.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-smartscan-works">How SmartScan Works:</h3>

<p>While you‚Äôre enjoying your coffee, thinking about what to pack or waiting for your package, we‚Äôll scan the information from the receipt without any more input necessary from you.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First it uses <strong>‚Äúoptical character recognition‚Äù (OCR)</strong> on receipt images to extract the text from the image.</li>
  <li>Then it analyzes that text to determine what portions correspond to the <strong>merchant name</strong>, <strong>amount</strong>, <strong><a href="https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5743/deep-dive-currency-in-expensify-overview/">currency</a></strong>, and <strong>date</strong> of the purchase. If it can‚Äôt detect a specific currency symbol, it will default to the currency based on your current location. You can also write one in by hand if it‚Äôs not noted!</li>
  <li>Finally, SmartScan consults your list of existing expenses to see if the newly processed receipt image corresponds to a purchase that has already been imported via a credit card connection or CSV spreadsheet. We will then merge these transactions. <strong>Different currencies?</strong> No problem. We‚Äôll still match ‚Äòem.</li>
</ol>

<p>If our OCR technology can‚Äôt read the receipt, we will make sure it‚Äôs flagged for human review by one of our secure technicians. At the end of the day, nothing beats the human eye for ultimate quality.</p>

<h2 id="will-an-ereceipt-merge-with-a-smartscan-or-emailed-receipt">Will an eReceipt merge with a SmartScan or emailed receipt?</h2>

<h2 id="why-did-concierge-reach-out-about-my-smartscan">Why did Concierge reach out about my SmartScan?</h2>

<p>When Concierge reaches out it means that your receipt was most likely missing one or more of these: merchant name, purchase date, or total amount. SmartScan requires these three data points to be present because it‚Äôs the only way to ensure it‚Äôs a traceable, legitimate receipt.</p>
