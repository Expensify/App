Though we do a lot, you've got a lot of options for everything we do.  But you should use us because we are:
Simple enough for individuals - We've worked extremely hard to make a product that strips out all the complex jargon and enterprise baggage, and gives you a simple tool that doesn't overwhelm you with functionality and language you don't understand.

Powerful enough for enterprises
: We've worked extremely hard to make a product that "scales up" to reveal increasingly sophisticated features, but only to those who need it, and only when they need it.  Expensify is used by public companies, multinational companies, companies with tens of thousands of employees, non-profits, investment firms, accounting firms, manufacturers, and basically every industry in every currency and in every country around the world.  If you are a company, we can support your needs, no matter how big or small.

6 products for the price of 1

## Concepts
The Expensify Superapp has a lot of moving pieces, so let's break them down one by one.

### What makes Expensify a superapp?
A "superapp" is a single app that combines multiple products into one seamlessly interconnected experience.  Expensify isn't a "suite" of separate products linked through a single account – Expensify is a single app with a single core design that can perform multiple product functions.  The secret to making such a seamless experience is that we build all product functions atop the same common core:

App
: The basis of the superapp experience is the actual app itself, which runs on your mobile phone or desktop computer.  (What is the Expensify app?)

Chats
: Even if you don't plan on using Expensify Chat for enterprise-grade workspace collaboration, chat is infused through the entire product.  (What is a chat?)

Expense
: Even if you aren't actively managing your expenses, you've still got them.  Every product that deals with money is ultimately dealing with expenses of some kind.  (What is an expense?)

Workspace
: Though Expensify works great for our millions of individual members, every product really shines when used between groups of members sharing a "workspace".  (What is a workspace?)

Domain
: To support more advanced security features, many products provide extra functionality to members who are on the same email "domain".  (What is a  domain?)

These are the foundational concepts you'll see again and again that underpin the superapp as a whole.

### What is the Expensify app?
Just like your eyes are a window to your soul, the Expensify App is the doorway through which you experience the entire global world of interconnected chat-centric collaborative data that comprises the Expensify network.  The main tools of this app consist of:

Inbox
: The main screen of the app is the Inbox, which highlights exactly what you should do next, consolidated across all products.  (What does the Inbox do?)

Search
: The next major screen is Search, which as you'd expect, let's you search everything across all products, from one convenient and powerful place.  (What does Search do?)

Settings
: Settings wraps up all your personal, workspace, and domain configuration options, all in one helpful space.  (What are Expensify's settings?)

Create
: Finally, the big green plus button is the Create button, which lets you create pretty much anything, across all the products.  (What does the Create button do?)

It's a deceptively simple app, with a few very familiar looking screens and buttons that unlock an incredible range of sophisticated multi-product power.
