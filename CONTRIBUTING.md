# Contributing to Expensify.cash
Welcome! Thanks for checking out Expensify.cash and for taking the time to contribute!

## Getting Started
This guide is for external contributors. Check out our README guidelines here for a general overview of the code repository, how to run the app locally, testing, storage, etc. 

We recommend reviewing this “Contributing to Expensify.cash” guide and the README before asking questions, as it may be covered within the documentation.

## Code of Conduct
This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Expensify [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Expensify/Expensify.cash/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [contributors@expensify.com](mailto:contributors@expensify.com).

## Asking Questions
If you have any general questions, please ask in the #expensify-contributors Slack channel. To request an invite to the channel, just email contributors@expensify.com with the subject `Slack Channel Invite` and we'll send you an invite!

If you are hired for an Upwork job, please ask any job-specific questions within the GitHub issue or pull request. This will ensure that the person addressing your question has as much context as possible. The Expensify team will not be able to respond to any direct messages or direct tags in Slack. 

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you've found a vulnerability, please email security@expensify.com with the subject `Vulnerability Report` instead of creating an issue.

## Payment for Contributions
We hire and pay external contributors via Upwork.com. If you'd like to be paid for contributing, please create an Upwork account and apply for a job in the [Upwork issue list](https://www.upwork.com/ab/jobs/search/?q=Expensify%20React%20Native&sort=recency&user_location_match=2). Payment for your contributions will be made no less than 7 days after the pull request is merged to allow for regression testing. We hire one contributor for each Upwork job. New contributors are limited to working on one job at a time.

## Finding Expensify.cash Jobs
There are two ways you can find an Expensify.cash job that you can contribute to: 

#### Finding a job that Expensify posted
This is the most common scenario for contributors. The Expensify team posts Expensify.cash jobs to the Upwork job list [here](https://www.upwork.com/ab/jobs/search/?q=Expensify%20React%20Native&sort=recency&user_location_match=2). Each job in Upwork has a corresponding GitHub issue, which will include instructions to follow. 

#### Proposing a job that Expensify hasn’t posted

In this scenario, it’s possible that you found a bug or enhancement that we haven’t posted to the [Upwork job list](https://www.upwork.com/ab/jobs/search/?q=Expensify%20React%20Native&sort=recency&user_location_match=2) or [Github repository](https://github.com/Expensify/Expensify.cash/issues?q=is%3Aissue). This may be an opportunity to propose a job and/or solve the issue for compensation. In this case please take the following steps:

    1. Check to ensure an issue does not already exist in the Expensify.cash Issue list or Upwork job list. Please use your best judgement to search for similar titles and issue descriptions. 
    2. If your bug or enhancement matches an existing issue, please feel free to comment on that GitHub issue with your findings if you think it’ll help solve a problem. 
    3. If there is no existing issue or Upwork job, create a new GitHub issue in the Expensify.cash repo. 
    4. Make sure to fill out all the required information fields in the issue template. 
    5. Optional: If you would like to solve the bug or enhancement that you are proposing, please add a comment on your issue with a solution proposal. 
    6. Pause on this step until a member of the Expensify team responds on your issue with next steps.

5. Pause at this step until Expensify provides feedback on your proposal (do not begin coding or creating a pull request yet). 
6. If your solution proposal is accepted, Expensify will hire you on Upwork and assign the GitHub issue to you.

- Please keep the conversation in GitHub, and do not ping individual reviewers in Slack or Upwork to get their attention.
