/**
 * Method which waits for all asynchronous JS to stop executing before proceeding. This helps test things like actions
 * that expect some Onyx value to be available. This way we do not have to explicitly wait for an action to finish
 * (e.g. by making it a promise and waiting for it to resolve).
 *
 * **Note:** It is recommended to wait for the Onyx operations, so in your tests its preferred to do:
 *  ✅  Onyx.merge(...).then(...)
 *  than to do
 *  ❌  Onyx.merge(...)
 *      waitForBatchedUpdates().then(...)
 *
 * @returns {Promise}

        // and we want those task to run before our scheduled task.

        //
        //   Onyx.merge(...)
        //   return waitForBatchedUpdates().then(...);
