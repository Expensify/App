// There are some methods that are OK to use inside an action file, but should not be exported. These are typically methods that look up and return Onyx data.
// The correct pattern to use is that every file will use it's own withOnyx or Onyx.connect() to access the Onyx data it needs. This prevents data from becoming stale
// and prevents side-effects that you may not be aware of. It also allows each file to access Onyx data in the most performant way. More context can be found in
// https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/27262
