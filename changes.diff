             1. Now that your first PR has been merged, you can be hired for another issue. Once you've completed a few issues, you may be eligible to work on more than one job at a time.
             2. Once your PR is deployed to our staging servers, it will undergo quality assurance (QA) testing. If we find that it doesn't work as expected or causes a regression, you'll be responsible for fixing it. Typically, we would revert this PR and give you another chance to create a similar PR without causing a regression.

 #### Finding a job that Expensify posted
 This is the most common scenario for contributors. The Expensify team posts new jobs to the Upwork job list [here](https://www.upwork.com/ab/jobs/search/?q=Expensify%20React%20Native&sort=recency&user_location_match=2) (you must be signed in to Upwork to view jobs). Each job in Upwork has a corresponding GitHub issue, which will include instructions to follow. You can also view open jobs by searching for issues in GitHub with the [`Help Wanted` label](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22).

 It’s possible that you found a bug or enhancement that we haven’t posted to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues?q=is%3Aissue). This is an opportunity to propose a job, and (optionally) a solution. If it's a valid job proposal that we choose to implement by deploying it to production — either internally or via an external contributor — then we will compensate you $250 for identifying and proposing the improvement.
 - Note: If you get assigned the job you proposed **and** you complete the job, this $250 for identifying the improvement is *in addition to* the reward you will be paid for completing the job.

 2. If your bug or enhancement matches an existing issue, please feel free to comment on that GitHub issue with your findings if you think it will help solve the issue.
 4. If there is no existing GitHub issue or Upwork job, check if the issue is happening on prod (as opposed to only happening on dev)
 5. If the issue is just in dev then it means it's a new issue and has not been deployed to production. In this case, you should try to find the offending PR and comment in the issue tied to the PR and ask the assigned users to add the `DeployBlockerCash` label. If you can't find it, follow the reporting instructions in the next item, but note that the issue is a regression only found in dev and not in prod.

+User input that may include optional characters (e.g. (, ), - in a phone number) should never be restricted on input, nor be modified or formatted on blur. This type of input jacking is disconcerting and makes things feel broken. 
 
 Instead we will format and clean the user input internally before using the value (e.g. making an API request where the user will never see this transformation happen). Additionally, users should always be able to copy/paste whatever characters they want into fields.

-Understanding the offline behavior of our app is vital to becoming a productive contributor to the Expensify codebase. Our mission is to support our users in every possible environment, and often our app is used in places where a stable internet connection is not guaranteed.
+Understanding the offline behavior of our app is vital to becoming a productive contributor to the Expensify codebase. Our mission is to support our users in every possible environment, and often our app is used in places where a stable internet connection is not guaranteed. 
 
-The most important concept to keep in mind while reading this document is that we want to allow users to do as much as possible when offline. At first, this might seem impossible because almost everything the user can touch in our app is related to an API request. However, in many cases, we can save that API request and assume it will succeed when the user is back online. We then allow the user to proceed as if their request already succeeded. We call this an optimistic response. Here, we use the word **optimistic** to indicate that we're confident the request will succeed when the user is online, and we know what that successful response will look like.

+# PR review guidelines
+
+This document lists specific guidelines for all PR reviews and aims to clarify items in the PR template checklist.
+
+# Check PR template
+
+1. Make sure the “Fixed Issues” section is formatted correctly. Links should be clickable and lead to the correct issue being fixed by this PR.
+2. Make sure the testing steps are clear and correctly test the changes made. Make note of what’s required for the test account (i.e. do you need to test using a brand new account, have a workspace, have a bank account, etc).
+    - > **Rule of thumb**: Over-explain what the tester needs to do. Do not rely on the tester having existing knowledge of the app.
+      > 
+      > ### Example of bad steps:
+      >
+	  >	1. Go to this page
+	  >	2. Click the button
+      >
+      > ### Example of good steps:
+      >
+      > 1. Log in with an account that has a workspace, or follow `[these steps](link-to-instructions-for setting-up-workspace)` to make one.
+      > 2. Click the settings button on the top left (the one with your avatar)
+      > 3. Navigate to “Your Workspace” > Reimburse Receipts > Connect bank account
+      > 4. Verify that the bank account view opens without errors
+      >
+    - Take note of the distinction between testing _locally_ and _on staging_. Note: The staging site references the production version of the API.
+3. Make sure that the test includes both **success** and **fail** scenarios.
+    - Ex: if the issue was to prevent the user from saving a field when it is empty, besides testing that we should also test that they can save the field _if it is not empty_.
+
+# Testing the changes
+
+1. Make sure there are no console errors related to the PR. If you find console errors in a branch you’re reviewing, check if they also exist in `main`.
+    1. If they do, proceed as normal (report them in #expensify-open-source if you think they need to be fixed).
+    2. If the errors do not exist in `main`, report it to the PR author - they need to be fixed before the PR can be merged.
+2. Test the changes on **all platforms**. Follow this guide (needs link) to set up each platform.
+    - If you’re unable to boot a platform for any reason, ask for help in the #expensify-open-source Slack channel. Your issue might already have been addressed there, so be sure to search first.
+
+# Reviewing the code
+
+## Good code patterns to require
+
+1. Check that functions have comments when appropriate.
+    - If the function has params or returns something, use [JSDocs syntax]((https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) to describe them.
+        - Indicate the param name(s), data type passed and / or returned, and purpose if not immediately obvious.
+    - Obvious functions (with no params / return value) should not have comments.
+    - **In short: _Add comments & docs, only when useful._**
+2. All copy / text shown to users in the product should be stored in the `src/languages/*` files for localization.
+3. Platform-specific files should follow the proper naming convention (see [Platform-Specific File Extensions](https://github.com/expensify/app#platform-specific-file-extensions))
+    - Example: `MyComponent/index.android.js`
+
+## Code patterns to improve
+
+1. Platform-specific solutions should not be applied to more platforms than necessary
+    - E.g. solutions for Android or iOS should go in specific `index.android.js` or `index.ios.js` files, not in an `index.native.js` file.
+2. Were any new styles added? Are we following the guidelines in [`STYLING.md`](./STYLING.md)?
+
+## Code patterns to avoid
+
+1. Make sure any `setTimeout`s are absolutely necessary, not just a workaround for a situation that isn’t fully understood (e.g. a race condition).
+2. Ensure Onyx is used appropriately. ([docs](https://github.com/expensify/react-native-onyx#merging-data))
+
+## Considerations around code reuse
+
+While trying to keep our code DRY (don't repeat yourself), you may find yourself trying to decide between refactoring & reusing a component vs. creating a brand new component. When in doubt about whether something should be reused or refactored, ask for help.
+
+Here are some guidelines we use in order to make the best decisions:
+
+1. Specialization
+    - When one component is a special case of another, we should opt for the technique of composition. Here are the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html#specialization) on Specialization. The idea is that it’s better to establish a pattern of creating increasingly specific components, instead of adding dozens of use cases to a single component.
+    - You might consider this when a component is being reused because the new use case is “close enough” to the original. Rather than adding functionality to that component with subtle additions, it may be better to create a new, more specialized version of that component.
+1. Refactors
+    - During a code review it often becomes apparent that a refactor is needed. In this case, we recommend following these steps:
+        1. Identify the refactor and confirm with others that it’s needed.
+        2. Do that refactor first (as a separate job, if it qualifies), merge it, test for regressions.
+        3. Proceed with the original issue & job.

-# PR review guidelines
-
-This document lists specific guidelines for all PR reviews and aims to clarify items in the PR template checklist.
-
-# Check PR template
-
-1. Make sure the “Fixed Issues” section is formatted correctly. Links should be clickable and lead to the correct issue being fixed by this PR.
-2. Make sure the testing steps are clear and correctly test the changes made. Make note of what’s required for the test account (i.e. do you need to test using a brand new account, have a workspace, have a bank account, etc).
-    - > **Rule of thumb**: Over-explain what the tester needs to do. Do not rely on the tester having existing knowledge of the app.
-      > 
-      > ### Example of bad steps:
-      >
-	  >	1. Go to this page
-	  >	2. Click the button
-      >
-      > ### Example of good steps:
-      >
-      > 1. Log in with an account that has a workspace, or follow `[these steps](link-to-instructions-for setting-up-workspace)` to make one.
-      > 2. Click the settings button on the top left (the one with your avatar)
-      > 3. Navigate to “Your Workspace” > Reimburse Receipts > Connect bank account
-      > 4. Verify that the bank account view opens without errors
-      >
-    - Take note of the distinction between testing _locally_ and _on staging_. Note: The staging site references the production version of the API.
-3. Make sure that the test includes both **success** and **fail** scenarios.
-    - Ex: if the issue was to prevent the user from saving a field when it is empty, besides testing that we should also test that they can save the field _if it is not empty_.
-
-# Testing the changes
-
-1. Make sure there are no console errors related to the PR. If you find console errors in a branch you’re reviewing, check if they also exist in `main`.
-    1. If they do, proceed as normal (report them in #expensify-open-source if you think they need to be fixed).
-    2. If the errors do not exist in `main`, report it to the PR author - they need to be fixed before the PR can be merged.
-2. Test the changes on **all platforms**. Follow this guide (needs link) to set up each platform.
-    - If you’re unable to boot a platform for any reason, ask for help in the #expensify-open-source Slack channel. Your issue might already have been addressed there, so be sure to search first.
-
-# Reviewing the code
-
-## Good code patterns to require
-
-1. Check that functions have comments when appropriate.
-    - If the function has params or returns something, use [JSDocs syntax]((https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) to describe them.
-        - Indicate the param name(s), data type passed and / or returned, and purpose if not immediately obvious.
-    - Obvious functions (with no params / return value) should not have comments.
-    - **In short: _Add comments & docs, only when useful._**
-2. All copy / text shown to users in the product should be stored in the `src/languages/*` files for localization.
-3. Platform-specific files should follow the proper naming convention (see [Platform-Specific File Extensions](https://github.com/expensify/app#platform-specific-file-extensions))
-    - Example: `MyComponent/index.android.js`
-
-## Code patterns to improve
-
-1. Platform-specific solutions should not be applied to more platforms than necessary
-    - E.g. solutions for Android or iOS should go in specific `index.android.js` or `index.ios.js` files, not in an `index.native.js` file.
-2. Were any new styles added? Are we following the guidelines in [`STYLING.md`](./STYLING.md)?
-
-## Code patterns to avoid
-
-1. Make sure any `setTimeout`s are absolutely necessary, not just a workaround for a situation that isn’t fully understood (e.g. a race condition).
-2. Ensure Onyx is used appropriately. ([docs](https://github.com/expensify/react-native-onyx#merging-data))
-
-## Considerations around code reuse
-
-While trying to keep our code DRY (don't repeat yourself), you may find yourself trying to decide between refactoring & reusing a component vs. creating a brand new component. When in doubt about whether something should be reused or refactored, ask for help.
-
-Here are some guidelines we use in order to make the best decisions:
-
-1. Specialization
-    - When one component is a special case of another, we should opt for the technique of composition. Here are the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html#specialization) on Specialization. The idea is that it’s better to establish a pattern of creating increasingly specific components, instead of adding dozens of use cases to a single component.
-    - You might consider this when a component is being reused because the new use case is “close enough” to the original. Rather than adding functionality to that component with subtle additions, it may be better to create a new, more specialized version of that component.
-1. Refactors
-    - During a code review it often becomes apparent that a refactor is needed. In this case, we recommend following these steps:
-        1. Identify the refactor and confirm with others that it’s needed.
-        2. Do that refactor first (as a separate job, if it qualifies), merge it, test for regressions.
-        3. Proceed with the original issue & job.

 #### WRITE Response Errors
 When there is an error on a WRITE response (`jsonCode!==200`), the error must come back to the client on the HTTPS response. The error is only relevant to the client that made the request and it wouldn't make sense to send it out to all connected clients.

-# Welcome to the Expensify Help site
-
-[Expensify Help](https://help.expensify.com/) is mainly composed of static HTML (`.html`) and Markdown (`.md`) files. We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate a static site from those HTML and Markdown files.
-
-### Table of Contents
-* [Testing Locally](#testing-locally)
-* [How the project is structured](#how-the-project-is-structured)
-* [How to add a new Article](#how-to-add-a-new-article)
-* [How the site is deployed](#how-the-site-is-deployed)
-
-# Testing Locally
-
-## Pre-requisites
-
-- Clone and/or pull the [App repo](https://github.com/Expensify/App) to your local machine.
-- Check the [requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll.
-- Install Jekyll locally by running:
-```
-gem install bundler
-cd docs
-bundle install
-```
-
-## Steps
-
-1. Open the Terminal command line in macOS.
-2. Navigate to the `docs` folder in the command line.
-3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`.
-    - _Note: If you see an error like `Unable to load the EventMachine C Extension...`, try running `gem uninstall eventmachine && bundle install`. If that doesn't work just removing the `--livereload` flag should work._
-4. Open http://localhost:4000 in the browser to see the site running locally.
-5. Modify a `.html` or `.md` file and refresh the page in the browser.
-
-# How the project is structured
-
-The [docs](https://github.com/Expensify/App/tree/main/docs) folder will contain the following main folders:
-- *_layouts*: This contains HTML templates used by Jekyll to create pages in the static site. For now it has only one file ([default.html](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/_layouts/default.html)) which will render the common HTML elements and the assets on every page. It also supports the use of the [liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).
-- *_includes*: Contains HTML content that can be reused on different pages. For now, it contains various html elements that are used to populate the left-hand-nav (LHN).
-- *assets*: it will contain the three sub-folders css, images, and js.
-  - The css folder can contain either .css or .sass files (where SASS files will be processed by Jekyll and it will generate a CSS file in an output folder also generated by Jekyll).
-  -  In order to organize the image files, we're going to have multiple sub-folders grouped by subject in the images folder.
-- *hubs*: it will contain two HTML files that will have the content of the `Request Money` and `Send Money` hub pages respectively.
-- *articles*: it will contain sub-folders for each stage and each of them will contain all the articles related to that stage or subsection.
-- *_site*: this will be the output folder that will contain the generated HTML files. This is the default name by Jekyll but can be changed.
-index.html: it will have the homepage content.
-
-More details about the Jekyll project structure can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).
-
-# How to add a new Article
-
-## Add content
-
-Copy the [template](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/TEMPLATE.md) file and rename it with the name of the article title, i.e. [SmartScan.md](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/articles/request-money/SmartScan.md) (you can use dashes for spaces in the file name if it's needed) and put the new file inside of the respective hub folder or sub-folder. The title will be rendered automatically according to the filename (the dashes will be removed in the generated site page).
-
-The sections of the article will be filled and nested automatically in the LHN, just ensure to use the [heading markdown tags](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) correctly.
-
-## Add a new entry in the hub page
-
-There are 3 main components in the hub page: 1. Stage title, 2. Row of Card buttons and 3. Card buttons.
-
-```html
-<!-- 1. Stage title -->
-<h2 id="request-money">
-    Request Money
-</h2>
-
-<!-- 2. Row of Card buttons -->
-<div class="cards-group">
-
-    <!-- 3. Card buttons -->
-
-    <div class="card" onclick="navigateTo('./request-money/SmartScan')">
-        <div class="body">
-            <div class="title">SmartScan</div>
-        </div>
-        <div class="right-icon">
-            <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right icon"></i>
-        </div>
-    </div>
-
-    <div class="card" onclick="navigateTo('./request-money/AnotherArticle')">
-        <div class="body">
-            <div class="title">Another Article</div>
-        </div>
-        <div class="right-icon">
-            <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right icon"></i>
-        </div>
-    </div>
-
-    <!-- More Card buttons here... -->
-
-</div>
-```
-### Add a Stage title (optional)
-
-In order to add a new stage title in the hub page just copy and paste the following HTML block in the respective hub page and modify the values accordingly:
-
-```html
-<h2 id="request-money">
-    Request Money
-</h2>
-```
-
-Where `id` is an arbitrary value that will help us to anchor this title to the LHN element.
-
-### Add a Row of Card buttons (optional)
-
-If it's required, you can add a new row of Card buttons with the following HTML block:
-
-```html
-<div class="cards-group">
-    <!-- Add Cards components here -->
-</div>
-```
-
-### Add a Card button
-
-A card button is the box that contains the article title and the caret right icon `>`. It navigates to the article when it's pressed.
-
-In order to add a new Card button in the respective hub page ([send-money/index.html](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/hubs/send-money.html) or [request-money/index.html](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/hubs/request-money.html)) just copy and pase the following Card element:
-
-```html
-<div class="card" onclick="navigateTo('./request-money/SmartScan')">
-    <div class="body">
-        <div class="title">SmartScan</div>
-    </div>
-    <div class="right-icon">
-        <i class="fa-solid fa-angle-right icon"></i>
-    </div>
-</div>
-```
-
-Then replace the article title accordingly (in this case replace the value `SmartScan` with the new article title) and add a link to the relative path of the article (in this case replace `./request-money/SmartScan` accordingly to the path of the new article file without the file extension).
-
-## Add a new entry in the LHN page
-
-There are 2 main components in the LHN page associated with the hub you're adding an article to:
-  1. Stage title anchor: which navigates the Stage title in the hub page and contains an unordered list of Article links.
-  2. Article links: which navigate to the corresponding article page.
-
-```html
-<!-- 1.Stage title anchor -->
-<li><a href="#request-money">Request Money</a>
-    <!-- 2. Article links -->
-    <ul>
-        <li><a href="./request-money/SmartScan">SmartScan</a></li>
-        <li><a href="./request-money/AnotherArticle">Another Article</a></li>
-        <!-- More Article links here... -->
-    </ul>
-</li>
-
-<!-- More Stage title anchors here... -->
-```
-
-### Add a new Stage title anchor (optional)
-
-Just add copy and paste the following HTML block in the corresponding navigation tree file (either for [Request Money](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/_includes/request-money-lhn.html) or [Send Money](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/_includes/send-money-lhn.html)):
-
-```
-<li><a href="#request-money">Request Money</a>
-    <!-- Article links will be here -->
-</li>
-```
-
-Where `"#request-money"` is the ID of Stage title in the hub page (the same as in the example of the `Add a Stage title (optional)` section).
-
-### Add a new Article link
-
-Add the next HTML block inside of the corresponding Stage title anchor:
-
-```
-<ul>
-    <li><a href="./request-money/SmartScan">SmartScan</a></li>
-</ul>
-```
-
-Where `./request-money/SmartScan` will be the relative path of the file name (exactly the same as in the `Add a Card button` example above).
-
-# How the site is deployed
-This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages has a built-in Jekyll integration, and we have it configured such that whenever code is merged to main, GitHub will automatically build the Jekyll site housed in the `/docs` directory and deploy it straight to production. The help site is publicly discoverable at https://help.expensify.com/

-# About
-<!--
-This short blurb provides all the context the user might need to know what the feature is and why they'd use it. If there are particular best practices embedded in the design, we'd explain why they're best practices here.
-
-What advantages does this feature provide in general?
-What is unique about this feature in terms of our specific implementation of it in Expensify?
--->
-
-# How-to
-<!--
-This section covers the most essential information a user needs to operate a feature i.e. what to click on. We’ll go over any action the user might take when configuring or using the feature, starting from configuration and moving to usage.
-
-What options does a user have when configuring this feature?
-What options does a user have then interacting with this feature?
-What elements of this feature are pay-walled vs. free?
--->
-
-# FAQ
-<!--
-This section covers the useful but not as vital information, it should capture commonly queried elements which do not organically form part of the About or How-to sections.
-
-- What's idiosyncratic or potentially confusing about this feature?
-- Is there anything unique about how this feature relates to billing/activity?
-- If this feature is released, are there any common confusions that can't be solved by improvements to the product itself?
-- Similarly, if this feature hasn't been released, can you predict and pre-empt any potential confusion?
-- Is there any general troubleshooting for this feature?
- - Note: troubleshooting should generally go in the FAQ, but if there is extensive troubleshooting, such as with integrations, that will be housed in a separate page, stored with and linked from the main page for that feature.
--->
-
-# Deep Dive
-<!--
-This section will be the final nice-to-know section which covers additional Best Practices that apply to niche use-cases, alternate setup configurations, and in-depth details for parts of a feature that do not apply to all users. These will likely only be required for very complex features with high configurability.
-
-- Is the feature multi-layered (contains features within features) and needs further explanation in this section? Example: Managing Domains.
-- Does the feature have several different variables that can cause different outcomes for different customers? Example: Billing.
-- Does the feature have optional enhancements that can be used in different ways depending on the use case? Example: Category-specifc rules.

-# About
-SmartScan is the time-saving tool that every Expensify user needs. Using SmartScan, you can quickly upload receipts and walk away to take care of more important things. Behind the scenes, SmartScan will process the expense data from your receipt and create an expense or automatically attach the receipt to a matching imported credit card expense.
-
-## What is SmartScan?
-
-SmartScan is simple on the outside and complex on the inside. When you SmartScan a receipt, we’ll read the **Merchant**, **Date** and **Amount** of the transaction, create an expense, and add it to your Expensify account automatically. If you have a credit card connected and you upload a receipt that matches a card expense, the SmartScanned receipt will automatically merge with the imported expense instead!
-- Expensify accounts come with 25 free SmartScans per month. If you’re an individual user and you need access to unlimited SmartScans, check out the [Monthly Subscription](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5535/deep-dive-the-monthly-subscription-is-it-right-for-me)!
-- If your organization is already using Expensify and you belong to a company policy, you’ll have access to unlimited SmartScans by default.
-
-### How SmartScan Works:
-
-While you're enjoying your coffee, thinking about what to pack or waiting for your package, we’ll scan the information from the receipt without any more input necessary from you.
-
-1. First it uses **“optical character recognition” (OCR)** on receipt images to extract the text from the image.
-2. Then it analyzes that text to determine what portions correspond to the **merchant name**, **amount**, **[currency](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5743/deep-dive-currency-in-expensify-overview/)**, and **date** of the purchase. If it can't detect a specific currency symbol, it will default to the currency based on your current location. You can also write one in by hand if it's not noted!
-3. Finally, SmartScan consults your list of existing expenses to see if the newly processed receipt image corresponds to a purchase that has already been imported via a credit card connection or CSV spreadsheet. We will then merge these transactions. **Different currencies?** No problem. We'll still match 'em.
-
-If our OCR technology can't read the receipt, we will make sure it's flagged for human review by one of our secure technicians. At the end of the day, nothing beats the human eye for ultimate quality.
-
-# How-to
-
-## Use Smartscan to create expenses
-
-You can SmartScan receipts from a variety of sources to quickly and easily create expenses.
-
-### SmartScan physical receipts with the Expensify mobile app
-- Open Expensify app and use the big green camera button to snap a photo. Use 3D touch to make it even faster!
-- Tap "Add details" to add a description if you want to, or select a custom category or tag.
-- Put your phone back in your pocket and forget about the receipt entirely.
-- Toss your receipt in the trash... Or burn it! We’ll take over from here!
-
-### SmartScan digital or emailed receipts by emailing them to receipts@expensify.com
-
-### SmartScan a web receipt with the [Expensify Chrome Extension](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/4680/how-to-download-and-use-the-chrome-extension)
-
-SmartScan runs in the background, so there’s no need to keep the app open. Most SmartScans complete within one hour, but it can take a bit longer—so don't worry! If we need more information from you, you’ll get a message from Concierge letting you know!
-
-## Email Receipts to Expensify
-
-All receipts in your email inbox, such as airline, rental car, hotel confirmations, online purchases, etc... can be added to your Expensify account simply by forwarding them to receipts@expensify.com. These email receipts will be SmartScanned and an expense will be created for you automatically in Expensify.
-
-### How to create an expense from a receipt email in your Expensify account:
-
-- Directly forward the email to receipts@expensify.com from the email address associated with your Expensify account.
-- Expensify will immediately SmartScan the receipt email.
-- You can then find the expense on the Expenses page, either listed under the date of the receipt (if the SmartScan has completed) or under the date that you forwarded the receipt (if the SmartScan has not completed extracting information from the receipt yet).
-
-### How to create an expense in Expensify with a receipt email from an email address that is different from your Expensify login:
-
-- You'll want to add this email address as a secondary login to your Expensify account. This way we associate any email receipts sent from this email to receipts@expensify.com and add them to the correct Expensify account.
-- Once the email address has been added as a secondary login, simply follow the steps above and forward these receipt emails to receipts@expensify.com.
-
-Pro tip: Expensify offer receipt integrations with popular apps such as Uber and Lyft where receipts are automatically imported into your account.
-
-## How-to: Email Receipts as a Copilot
-
-Because emailing receipts to receipts@expensify.com sends the receipts directly to the account tied to the senders email, there is an additional step you need to take when sending receipts as a copilot.
-
-1. Click forward on the email and address it to receipts@expensify.com
-2. Add the email address of the user whose account you want the receipts to go to in the subject line
-3. Click Send
-
-As long as you are a Copilot for this user, the receipts will be placed in their account and can be found on the Expenses page.
-
-### Can the Copilot's Secondary Logins be used to forward receipts?
-Yes! A Copilot can use any of the email addresses tied to their account to forward receipts into the account of the person they're assisting.
-
-# FAQ
-
-## How do I get unlimited SmartScans?
-
-If you belong to your company’s policy, you have unlimited SmartScans automatically. However, if you’re an individual user, purchase the Monthly Subscription to gain access to limitless SmartScans.
-
-## How can I SmartScan multiple receipts as quickly as possible?
-
-You can enable Rapid Fire of receipts by tapping the camera icon in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen when taking a picture of your receipts. With Rapid Fire enabled, you can snap away without ever being taken out of the camera to code your receipts.
-
-## SmartScanned receipts and credit card's currency are different. Will they still match?
-
-Yep! As long as the currency is clear, SmartScan is smart enough to convert to the proper currency (indicated by your policy or your account settings) and merge with the incoming credit card transaction.
-
-## Will an eReceipt merge with a SmartScan or emailed receipt?
-
-Yes! SmartScanned receipts will still merge with and override their eReceipt counterparts.
-
-## Will Duplicate Detection flag the same receipt even if I accidentally SmartScan it much later?
-
-[Duplicate Detection](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5644/deep-dive-duplicate-detection-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/p1?new=1) will look at all expenses in a single user’s Expensify account regardless of the date it is uploaded. As long as the date and amount match, then we will show a duplicate.
-
-## Why did Concierge reach out about my SmartScan?
-
-When Concierge reaches out it means that your receipt was most likely missing one or more of these: merchant name, purchase date, or total amount. SmartScan requires these three data points to be present because it’s the only way to ensure it’s a traceable, legitimate receipt.
-
-Want to know more about Concierge? Meet our friendly AI bot [here](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5515/deep-dive-meet-concierge/p1?new=1)!
-
-## Can I disable SmartScan?
-
-For users on Track, Submit and Collect policies, you can disable SmartScan in your account settings.
-
-1. Disabling SmartScan
-2. Log into your account using your preferred web browser,
-3. Head to your Settings > Your Account > Preferences > SmartScanning page,
-4. Click the green toggle to disable the feature.
-
-Please note: SmartScan is enabled for all Control plan policies to facilitate the Concierge Receipt Audit feature. You cannot disable SmartScan when defaulted to a Control policy.
