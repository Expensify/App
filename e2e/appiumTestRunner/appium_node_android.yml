  # The install phase includes commands that install dependencies that your tests use.
  # Default dependencies for testing frameworks supported on Device Farm are already installed.

      # You can switch to an alternate supported version from 1.6.5, 1.7.1, 1.7.2, 1.8.0 , 1.8.1, 1.9.1 by using a command like "avm 1.7.1"
      # OR
