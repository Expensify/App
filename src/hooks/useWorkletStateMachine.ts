/**
 * A hook that creates a state machine that can be used with Reanimated Worklets.
 * You can transition state from worklet or from the JS thread.
 *
 * State machines are helpful for managing complex UI interactions. We want to transition
 * between states based on user actions. But also we want to ignore some actions
 * when we are in certain states.
 *
 * For example:
 * 1. Initial state is idle. It can react to KEYBOARD_OPEN action.
 * 2. We open emoji picker. It sends EMOJI_PICKER_OPEN action.
 * 2. There is no handling for this action in idle state so we do nothing.
 * 3. We close emoji picker and it sends EMOJI_PICKER_CLOSE action which again does nothing.
 * 4. We open keyboard. It sends KEYBOARD_OPEN action. idle can react to this action
 * by transitioning into keyboardOpen state
 * 5. Our state is keyboardOpen. It can react to KEYBOARD_CLOSE, EMOJI_PICKER_OPEN actions
 * 6. We open emoji picker again. It sends EMOJI_PICKER_OPEN action which transitions our state
 * into emojiPickerOpen state. Now we react only to EMOJI_PICKER_CLOSE action.
 * 7. Before rendering the emoji picker, the app hides the keyboard.
 * It sends KEYBOARD_CLOSE action. But we ignore it since our emojiPickerOpen state can only handle
 * EMOJI_PICKER_CLOSE action. so we write the logic for handling hiding the keyboard
 * but maintaining the offset based on the keyboard state shared value
 * 7. we close the picker and send EMOJI_PICKER_CLOSE action which transitions us back into keyboardOpen state.
 *
 * State machine object example:
 * const stateMachine = {
 *   idle: {
 *       KEYBOARD_OPEN: 'keyboardOpen',
 *   },
 *   keyboardOpen: {
 *       KEYBOARD_CLOSE: 'idle',
 *       EMOJI_PICKER_OPEN: 'emojiPickerOpen',
 *   },
 *   emojiPickerOpen: {
 *       EMOJI_PICKER_CLOSE: 'keyboardOpen',
 *   },
 * }
 *
 * Initial state example:
 * {
 *     previous: null,
 *     current: {
 *         state: 'idle',
 *         payload: null,
 *     },
 * }
 *
 * @param stateMachine - a state machine object
 * @param initialState - the initial state of the state machine
 * @returns an object containing the current state, a transition function, and a reset function
