     * Initialize the Onyx store when the app loads for the first time.
     *
     * Note: This Onyx initialization has been very intentionally placed completely outside of the React lifecycle of the main App component.
     *
     * To understand why we must do this, you must first understand that a typical React Native Android application consists of an Application and an Activity.
     * The project root's index.js runs in the Application, but the main RN `App` component + UI runs in a separate Activity, spawned when you call AppRegistry.registerComponent.
     * When an application launches in a headless JS context (i.e: when woken from a killed state by a push notification), only the Application is available, but not the UI Activity.
     * This means that in a headless context NO REACT CODE IS EXECUTED, and none of your components will mount.
     *
     * However, we still need to use Onyx to update the underlying app data from the headless JS context.
     * Therefore it must be initialized completely outside the React component lifecycle.
