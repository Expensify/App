/**
 * This file is necessary because checkForUpdates needs to be imported by desktop/index.js
 * Since desktop/index.js is run by Electron directly (not bundled by Webpack),
 * and Electron doesn't yet support ES6 modules, we have to write this shim in CommonJS,
 * so that it can be `require`d by desktop.index.js.
 *
 * The good news is that this is temporary: Node 14 offers support for ES6 modules in CommonJS code,
 * so once Node 14 becomes LTS and is adopted by Electron, (likely in mid 2021),
 * we can remove this file and use its ES6 counterpart.
 *
 * We can track Electron's adoption of Node 14/ESM support in this GH issue:
 * https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21457
