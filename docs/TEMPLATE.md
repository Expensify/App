# FAQ
<!--
This section covers the useful but not as vital information, it should capture commonly queried elements which do not organically form part of the About or How-to sections.

- What's idiosyncratic or potentially confusing about this feature?
- Is there anything unique about how this feature relates to billing/activity?
- If this feature is released, are there any common confusions that can't be solved by improvements to the product itself?
- Similarly, if this feature hasn't been released, can you predict and pre-empt any potential confusion?
- Is there any general troubleshooting for this feature?
 - Note: troubleshooting should generally go in the FAQ, but if there is extensive troubleshooting, such as with integrations, that will be housed in a separate page, stored with and linked from the main page for that feature.

# Deep Dive
<!--
This section will be the final nice-to-know section which covers additional Best Practices that apply to niche use-cases, alternate setup configurations, and in-depth details for parts of a feature that do not apply to all users. These will likely only be required for very complex features with high configurability.

- Is the feature multi-layered (contains features within features) and needs further explanation in this section? Example: Managing Domains.
- Does the feature have several different variables that can cause different outcomes for different customers? Example: Billing.
- Does the feature have optional enhancements that can be used in different ways depending on the use case? Example: Category-specifc rules.
