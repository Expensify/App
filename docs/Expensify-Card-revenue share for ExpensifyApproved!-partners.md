We're offering  0.5% of the total Expensify Card spend of your clients in cashback returned to your firm. The more your clients spend, the more cashback your firm receives!<br>

# FAQ
- What if my firm is not permitted to accept revenue share from our clients? <br>

How will I know which clients to pay back? <br>
<br>Every month you will receive an automated message via new.expensify.com and email providing a breakdown of revenue shared generated per client.<br><br>
- What if my firm does not wish to participate in the program? <br>
<br>Please reach out to your assigned partner manager at new.expensify.com to inform them you would not like to accept the revenue share nor do you want to pass the revenue share to your clients.
