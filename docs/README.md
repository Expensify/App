# Welcome to the Expensify Help site

[Expensify Help](https://help.expensify.com/) is mainly composed of static HTML (`.html`) and Markdown (`.md`) files. We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate a static site from those HTML and Markdown files.

# Testing Locally

## Pre-requisites

- Clone and/or pull the [App repo](https://github.com/Expensify/App) to your local machine.
- Check the [requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install Jekyll.
- Install Jekyll locally by running:

```bash
gem install bundler
cd docs
bundle install
```

- On newer versions of macOS/Xcode you may see a `bundle install` error similar to the following. You can workaround it by symlinking whichever version of `universal-darwin` you have. More info in [this SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65481787/18466468).

```bash
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX13.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.6/usr/include/ruby-2.6.0/universal-darwin21/ruby/config.h', needed by arena.o'
```

```bash
cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX13.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.6/usr/include/ruby-2.6.0/
ln -sf universal-darwin22 universal-darwin21
```

## Steps

1. Open the Terminal command line in macOS.
1. Navigate to the `docs` folder in the command line.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`.
    - _Note: If you see an error like `Unable to load the EventMachine C Extension...`, try running `gem uninstall eventmachine && bundle install`. If that doesn't work just removing the `--livereload` flag should work._
1. Modify a `.html` or `.md` file and save your changes, and the browser should quickly auto-refresh.

# How the project is structured

The [docs](https://github.com/Expensify/App/tree/main/docs) folder will contain the following main folders:

- *_layouts*: Contains HTML templates used by Jekyll to create pages in the static site. For now, it has only one file ([default.html](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/_layouts/default.html)) which will render the common HTML elements and the assets on every page.
- *_includes*: Contains HTML content that can be reused on different pages. [Includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) can accept parameters and be nested, so they are quite powerful.
- *assets*: Contains the three sub-folders css, images, and js. The css folder can contain either .css or .sass files (where SASS files will be processed by Jekyll and it will generate a CSS file in an output folder also generated by Jekyll).
- *hubs*: Contains hubs that display various related articles, optionally grouped by sub-topic within the hub.
- *articles*: Contains sub-folders for each hub and each of them will contain all the articles related to that hub.
- *_data*: Contains [custom global data](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/), available anywhere via liquid with the syntax `site.data.<filename>`. Notably, there is a file called [routes.yml](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/55f2c73d8e3bb0efd0e2a985c05f25e87d28f3cc/docs/_data/routes.yml) in there which defines the structure of the app and metadata for its pages. 
- *_site*: The output folder that contains the generated HTML files. This is the default name by Jekyll but can be changed. Files in here are generated and should not be manually edited.
- index.html: The main homepage content.

More details about the Jekyll project structure can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/). Note that all html files in this project support the use of the [liquid template language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/).

# How to add a new Article

## Add content

Copy the [template](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/TEMPLATE.md) file into the correct subdirectory of `/articles`. For example, if the article belongs in the `Send money` hub, then copy the template into `articles/send-money` directory. Next, rename the copy with the name of the article title, i.e. [The-Free-Plan.md](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/docs/articles/send-money/The-Free-Plan.md) (you can use dashes for spaces in the file name if it's needed) and put the new file inside of the respective hub folder or sub-folder. The title will be rendered automatically according to the filename (the dashes will be removed in the generated site page).

The sections of the article will be filled and nested automatically in the LHN, just ensure to use the [heading markdown tags](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) correctly.

## Add meta-description tags for SEO

At the top of template file we're going to find a few variables that will help us to define the meta-description of the article for SEO:

```
---
title: The title of the post, page, or document
description: A short description of the page's content
image: (Optional) URL to an image associated with the post, page, or document (e.g., /assets/page-pic.jpg)
---
```

Just update the content for each variable accordingly or remove it if the information is not available. More details [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/blob/master/docs/usage.md#usage).

## Add the new page to routes.yml

Next, add the article to `_data/routes.yml`. Note that hubs contain one or more articles, which may or may not be grouped into sections with other related articles.

# How the site is deployed
This site is hosted on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages has a built-in Jekyll integration, and we have it configured such that whenever code is merged to main, GitHub will automatically build the Jekyll site housed in the `/docs` directory and deploy it straight to production. The help site is publicly discoverable at https://help.expensify.com/
