The Expensify Lounge is a place where people come to Get Shit Done. With beautiful surroundings, great coffee, and a collaborative community, it's the perfect environment to fuel productivity. Check out this guide on how to make the most of the Expensify Lounge!

# The Two Rules

## Rule #1 - Get Shit Done
The Lounge is designed to help you focus, collaborate, and bring your boldest ideas to life. To keep this environment productive, we ask our members to remember:

- **#focus** - Use the space as it’s intended, without disrupting others. The Lounge is social and collaborative but ultimately meant to support productive work.
- **#urgency** - Remote work is fantastic, but face-to-face collaboration is unmatched. Use the Lounge to meet co-workers in person and drive your projects forward.
- **#results** - Don’t confuse time spent with effort or effort with results. Visualize what you want to accomplish and don’t leave until it’s done.

## Rule #2 - Don’t Ruin It for Everyone Else
We want the Lounge to be an incredible, ever-evolving space. To achieve this, please follow these guidelines:

- **#writeitdown** - If you can share knowledge, do it! Write a blog post, document, or post in Expensify Chat to help others learn from your experience. Suggestions to improve the Lounge are always welcome.
- **#showup** - Be fully present when you’re here. Engage with others and collaborate in social spaces. This is a community built to get shit done; the more you contribute, the more you gain.
- **#oneteam** - Inclusivity is a priority. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination. Make an effort to include those who want to join.
- **#nocreeps** - Don’t make others feel uncomfortable with your words or actions. If you feel uncomfortable or notice it happening to someone else, use the escalation process in the FAQ.

# How to Use the Expensify Lounge
With these two rules in mind, here’s how to get the most from the Lounge:

## Rule #1 - Getting Shit Done
- **Order drinks from Concierge** - Contact Concierge here to ask questions or order beverages, and they’ll deliver your order to you.
- **Using an office** - Offices are first-come, first-serve, and ideal for brief calls or meetings. Please keep usage to under an hour. Offices cannot be reserved.
- **Lounge hours** - The Lounge is open from 8am-6pm PT, Monday through Friday, and closed on some major holidays. Check our Google Maps profile for holiday hours.
- **Suggest improvements** - Post any ideas to enhance the Lounge experience in #announce - Expensify Lounge.

## Rule #2 - Not Ruining It for Everyone Else
- **Offices are for calls** - Only use an office if you have a call or meeting, and try to keep it under an hour.
- **Respect others** - Avoid being too loud or distracting while others work. When collaborating in Expensify Chat, be respectful and maintain a positive environment.
- **Stay home if you’re sick** - If you’re feeling unwell, please skip the Lounge or wear a mask in public areas.
- **If you see something, say something** - If you feel uncomfortable or notice others in discomfort, notify Concierge. In Expensify Chat, you can also use our moderation tools (outlined in the FAQ).

We’re thrilled to have you here to live richly, have fun, and help save the world with us. Now, go enjoy the Expensify Lounge, and let’s Get Shit Done!

## What is Concierge? 
Concierge is our automated system that answers member questions in real-time. Local lounge questions are routed to the Lounge’s Concierge. Message Concierge for drink requests or general inquiries—they’ll handle it for you!

## Who is invited to the Expensify Lounge?
Everyone is invited! Whether you’re a current customer or just need a productive space, we’d love to have you.

## How do I escalate something that’s making me or someone else uncomfortable? 
In Expensify Chat, use the escalation feature to flag messages as:

- **Spam or Inconsiderate**: This sends a whisper to the sender and flags the message. These flags are visible to all users but not reviewed by Concierge.
- **Intimidating or Bullying**: The message is hidden and reviewed. If confirmed, it will remain hidden, and we’ll communicate the violation to the sender.
- **Harassment or Assault**: The message is hidden immediately, and our team reviews it. The sender receives a warning, and Concierge may block the user if needed.

In person, please notify Concierge with your lounge location, and they’ll escalate the issue accordingly.

## Where are other Expensify Lounge locations? 
Currently, we only have the San Francisco Lounge, but stay tuned for more locations coming soon!
