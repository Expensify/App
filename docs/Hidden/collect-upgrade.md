# FAQ

## Why did my Collect workspace get upgraded to Control?

We upgraded your Collect workspace(s) to Control at no extra cost to you to ensure that you retain access to the features you use when we updated our Collect plan.

## My workspace now shows Control, but my Expensify receipt says Collect. Why?

We upgraded your Collect workspace(s) to Control at no extra cost to you to ensure that you retain access to the features you use when we updated our Collect plan. In Expensify, you will see your workspace(s) as Control workspaces, but in your Expensify receipt, you will see any members as Collect workspace members with a customer appreciation discount.
