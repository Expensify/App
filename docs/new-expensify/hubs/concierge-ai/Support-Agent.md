When you have a question about Expensify, Concierge is your first responder. Whether you're setting up a feature or something isn't working quite right, the Support Agent is ready to help.

# What is a Support Agent?

A support agent helps you troubleshoot issues, answer questions, and navigate Expensify. Concierge becomes a Support Agent whenever you ask something about how the product works.

It’s AI-first, but backed by real people whenever needed.

# What kind of help can Concierge provide?

Concierge can handle most common support requests right away, like:

- ✅ Explaining Expensify features or settings  
- ✅ Walking you through how to configure something  
- ✅ Troubleshooting account issues  
- ✅ Scheduling onboarding or account manager calls (if available)  
- ❌ Reconfiguring your Workspace *for you* (coming soon)

If you’ve got a “how do I…?” question, Concierge is your go-to.

# Where can I ask for help?

You can reach Concierge in lots of ways:

- **In-app chat:**  
  - **Web:** Click the chat icon in the lower-right  
  - **Mobile:** Tap the hamburger menu, then tap **Concierge**
- **Workspace chat:** Mention Concierge in any room (like #admins)  
- **Expense or report chat:** Ask directly in the thread  
- **Email:** concierge@expensify.com  
- **Text:** 47777 (US only)

Wherever you ask, Concierge will use the context to give the most relevant answer.

# Can I talk to a human?

Yep—just say the word. If Concierge can’t solve your issue, or you’d prefer to talk to someone, it’ll hand things off to a real person.

Support is available 24/7 via chat.

# Can I talk to someone on the phone?

If you have an onboarding specialist or account manager, Concierge can help schedule a call with them. Just ask!

# What happens when Concierge doesn’t know something?

If the AI can’t help, it won’t leave you hanging. It’ll escalate your question to a human right away. No hoops to jump through, and no repeating yourself.

# Pro tip: Be specific

The more detail you give, the better Concierge can help. Try including things like:
- Report name or amount
- Expense description or merchant
- Exact error message (if any)
- What you were doing when the issue happened

That gives the Support Agent everything it needs to get you a quick answer—or pass it along to someone who can.
