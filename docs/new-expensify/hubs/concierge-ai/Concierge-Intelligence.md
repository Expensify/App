Concierge isn’t just smart—it’s **context-aware**, multi-skilled, and built to handle whatever you throw at it. Here’s how it understands your questions and gets things done faster than ever.

# How does Concierge work?

Concierge is a **hybrid AI agent** built on top of GenAI, automation tools, and a powerful rules engine. It figures out what you're trying to do, pulls in the right tools, and responds with answers—or actions.

If it doesn’t know something? It escalates to a real person.

# What makes Concierge intelligent?

Concierge uses a few smart tricks to figure out how to help:

- **Context-aware** – It knows *where* you’re asking, so it can tailor the response (more below).
- **Multi-modal** – It acts like different assistants (support agent, expense assistant, etc.) all in one conversation.
- **Hybrid support** – It combines AI + humans, switching seamlessly when needed.
- **Natural language understanding** – Just talk to it like you would to a coworker.

# What is contextual behavior?

Concierge adapts based on where and how you ask questions. That means:

- If you chat in a report → it answers about that report.  
- If you're in a DM → it considers all your expenses.  
- If you ask from a Workspace chat → it focuses on that Workspace.  
- If you're on a specific expense → it assumes you're talking about *that* expense.

You don’t have to explain every detail—just speak naturally and Concierge will fill in the blanks.

# What is a multi-modal agent?

Instead of having multiple bots for different things (like one for expenses and another for support), Concierge is **all-in-one**.

That means:
- You can ask anything—no need to figure out *who* to ask.  
- You can combine requests in one message.  
  - Example: “Is this reimbursable? Can you add a $12 taxi expense too?”

# Can I ask multiple things at once?

Definitely. Concierge can understand and respond to complex or multi-step questions—as long as it’s clear what you want.

Here’s what works well:
- “Create a $5 lunch expense and add it to my April report.”  
- “What does ‘non-reimbursable’ mean, and can you mark this expense as such?”

The key is being specific. The clearer you are, the better Concierge can help.

# What happens when Concierge doesn’t know something?

If the AI hits a wall, it won’t leave you hanging. It’ll bring in a real person—often without you needing to ask.

You can also say “Talk to a human” at any time, and Concierge will escalate the conversation.

# What powers Concierge behind the scenes?

Here’s what fuels its intelligence:
- A custom-trained GenAI model  
- A rules engine that handles logic and automation  
- Real-time access to your Expensify data (just enough to help)  
- Escalation paths for live support when needed

# TL;DR — What makes Concierge different?

- Knows where you’re chatting and tailors responses  
- Understands natural, multi-part questions  
- Does support, expenses, and reporting in one place  
- Switches to a human when it gets stuck  
- Just works—no setup, no training required
