Need to log an expense? Just tell Concierge. Whether you're snapping a receipt, recording mileage, or updating the merchant, the Expense Assistant has you covered.

# What is an Expense Assistant?

An expense assistant is a chatbot that can create, modify, and answer questions about expenses. Concierge becomes your Expense Assistant whenever you're talking about receipts, purchases, or mileage.

You don’t need to fill out forms—just ask, and Concierge does the rest.

# What can Concierge do automatically?

Concierge takes care of a bunch of expense tasks in the background:

- ✅ Categorizes expenses based on your Workspace rules  
- ✅ Applies categories based on your past behavior  
- ✅ Adds expenses to the right report  
- ✅ Moves held expenses to a new report when unheld ones are submitted  
- ❌ Tags expenses based on past behavior *(coming soon)*

# What can I ask Concierge to do?

### ✅ Create expenses

You can say things like:

- “Create a $5 Starbucks expense for coffee with Alice”  
- “Record 25 miles driving for lunch with Bob”  
- “Add a $60 dinner expense to my New York trip report”

You can also:
- Upload a receipt image directly in the chat  
- Email a receipt to **concierge@expensify.com**  
- Text a receipt to **47777** (US only)

### ✅ Modify expenses

Ask Concierge to:

- “Change the merchant to Extracto”  
- “Change the amount to $6”  
- “Categorize this as Client Meals”  
- “Mark this expense as non-reimbursable”  
- “Tag this to Bob’s Bananas”  
- “Update the description to matcha with Alice”

💡 *Coming soon:*  
- “Delete this expense”  
- “Categorize all Starbucks expenses as Coffee Meetings”  
- “Attach this receipt to that transaction”

# How do I tell Concierge which expense to update?

You don’t need to be exact—Concierge uses context to figure it out.

- **On an individual expense:** It’ll assume you mean *that* expense.  
- **In a report chat:** Reference the merchant, amount, or description.  
- **In a workspace chat:** It’ll focus on expenses within that Workspace.  
- **In a DM:** It may ask for clarification, since it could be about any expense.

In general, just say what feels natural—Concierge will try to match it to the right one.

# Can I add attendees or notes?

You can! Just include it in your request:

- “Create a $15 lunch expense with Alice and Bob”  
- “Add a note saying 'team celebration lunch’”  
- “Add Alice as an attendee”

If something's not supported yet, Concierge will let you know or escalate the request.

# What if I make a mistake?

No problem—just ask Concierge to update or fix the expense.

Example:  
> “Oops, that Starbucks expense was $7, not $5. Can you fix it?”

Concierge will update the amount and confirm the change.
