# FAQ

## What exchange rate is used for foreign currency purchases?

We use the [Visa FX calculator](https://www.visa.co.uk/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html) to determine exchange rates for purchases made in currencies other than GBP or EUR. Please ensure that you edit the bank fee to **0%** when using the calculator, as the Expensify Card does not incur any foreign exchange fees.
