2. Locate your physical card and click **Report card lost or damaged**.
3. Choose **My card was damaged**.
   - **Note:** Even if you haven't damaged the card, selecting that option allows you to update your address.
4. Enter your updated address under **Please confirm the mailing address for your new card** and click **Save**.
