# What to check if your Expensify Card is not working

## Expensify Card not activated

To check if your card is active:

- **On web:** Go to **Account > Wallet > Expensify Card** using the navigation tabs on the left.
- **On mobile:** Go to **Wallet > Expensify Card** using the navigation tabs at the bottom.

Then, click on your card. If it hasn’t been activated yet, you’ll see an **Activate physical card** prompt at the bottom of the screen. Follow the steps to complete activation.

## Expensify Card spend limit reached

Each Expensify Card has a spending limit set by your Workspace Admin. If your available limit is too low, your transactions may be declined.

To check your card’s remaining limit:

- **On web:** Go to **Account > Wallet > Expensify Card** using the navigation tabs on the left.
- **On mobile:** Go to **Wallet > Expensify Card** using the navigation tabs at the bottom.

Then, click on your card. Your **remaining limit** is displayed under the image of your Expensify Card. 

## Workspace limit has run out

Every workspace has a shared spend limit that affects all cards. If the workspace runs out of available funds or the bank account becomes [locked](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/wallet-and-payments/Unlock-a-Business-Bank-Account), all cards may stop working.

Workspace Admins can check the available limit by going to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Expensify Card**. From there, Workspace Admins can view the current balance, remaining limit, and any warnings related to settlement.

# FAQ

## How do I refresh the limit on my Expensify Card?

There are three types of limits that Workspace Admins can set:

- **Smart Limit:** Spend up to a certain amount before approval is required. This refreshes when the expenses are submitted and approved.
- **Monthly limit:** Spend up to a set amount per month. It refreshes automatically on the first of each month.
- **Fixed amount:** Spend up to a set amount once. This does **not** refresh.

You can view your limit type below your spending limit when viewing your card.

## Can one issue affect all Expensify Cards in a workspace?

Yes. If the workspace limit runs out or a bank account becomes locked due to a failed settlement, all cards in the workspace may be paused temporarily.

## How does a Workspace Admin check for workspace-level problems affecting Expensify Cards? 

Workspace Admins can check the workspace limit at **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Expensify Card**, under **Remaining limit**.
To check for bank account issues, navigate to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Bank Account**, then click the **Fix** button next to any locked account.


## How does a Workspace Admin refresh the workspace’s Expensify Card limit?

The workspace limit refreshes automatically after the workspace's regular Expensify Card settlement. To refresh it earlier:

1. Go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Expensify Card**
2. Click **Settle Balance** to trigger an early settlement.
3. Once the settlement clears, the workspace limit will be refreshed.
