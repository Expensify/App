# Upgrade your company’s Expensify Card program
This process must be completed by a Domain Admin. Any domain Admin can complete the upgrade, but only one admin needs to complete these steps. 

**Before updating the card program:**
- Make sure your employees' address is up-to-date in their Expensify account
- Confirm the employees who should be receiving a new Expensify Card have a card limit set that's greater than $0

## Steps to upgrade the Expensify Cards
1. On your Home page, click the task titled _Upgrade to the new and improved Expensify Card._
2. Review and agree to the Terms of Service.
3. Click **Get the new card**. All existing cardholders with a limit greater than $0 will be automatically mailed a new physical card to the address they have on file. Virtual cards will be automatically issued and available for immediate use. 
4. If you have Positive Pay enabled for your settlement account, contact your bank as soon as possible to whitelist the new ACH ID: 2270239450. 
5. Remind your employees to update their payment information for recurring charges to their virtual card information.

New cards will have the same limit as the existing cards. Each cardholder’s current physical and virtual cards will remain active until a Domain Admin or the cardholder deactivates it.

Cards won’t be issued to any employees who don’t currently have them. In this case, you’ll need to [issue a new card](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/expensify-card/Set-Up-the-Expensify-Visa%C2%AE-Commercial-Card-for-your-Company)

## Why don’t I see the task to agree to new terms on my Home page?

There are a few reasons why you might not see the task on your Home page:
- You may not be a Domain Admin
- Another domain admin has already accepted the terms
- The task may be hidden. To find hidden tasks, scroll to the bottom of the Home page and click **Show Hidden Tasks** to see all of your available tasks. 

## Will this affect the continuous reconciliation process?

No. During the transition period, you may have some employees with old cards and some with new cards, so you’ll have two different debits (settlements) made to your settlement account for each settlement period. Once all spending has transitioned to the new cards, you’ll only see one debit/settlement. 

## Do I have to upgrade to the new Expensify Visa® Commercial Card?

Yes, the Expensify Cards will not work on the old program. This must be completed by November 1, 2024.
