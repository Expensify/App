{% include faq-begin.md %}
**Do you need a specific type of bank account to use the Expensify Card?**

At this time, the Expensify Card requires a US business bank account opened in the name of a business incorporated in the US.

**Can I use the Expensify Card across multiple workspaces?**

You can use the Expensify Card on every workspace you create. However, a settlement account can only be used with the Expensify Card on one workspace. For example, if you’re using the Expensify Card on three workspaces, you need three settlement accounts.

**Can I issue multiple cards to the same employee?**

You can issue an unlimited number of both physical and virtual cards to employees. This supports a wide variety of different use cases, ranging from each employee only having one card, to employees having numerous cards for things like individual trips, specific purchases, etc.
