Once you receive your Expensify Visa® Commercial Card, you can activate it and start using it immediately. When you use your Expensify Card, expenses are automatically created, and SmartScanned receipts are matched to the corresponding transactions. For most purchases, excluding lodging, Expensify also generates IRS-compliant eReceipts. If your organization doesn't require itemized receipts, you can rely on eReceipts to meet documentation requirements.
