# FAQ

## What kind of bank account is required?

You’ll need a U.S. business bank account registered to a U.S.-incorporated business.

## Can I use Expensify Cards across multiple workspaces?

Yes, but each workspace must have its **own settlement account**. For example, using the card in three workspaces requires three separate bank accounts.

## Can an employee have multiple cards?

- **Yes**: Employees can have unlimited **virtual cards** (e.g. for trips or subscriptions).
- **No**: Only **one active, physical card** is allowed per employee. 

## How is the Expensify Card limit determined?

The limit is the maximum combined spending limit for all Expensify Cards in your domain. It’s calculated using:

- **Available balance** in the verified bank account set as your **settlement account**
- **Pending expenses** and **unsettled transactions**
- **Funds availability** tracked via **Plaid**
- **Settlement cycle timing**, which usually takes **three business days**

## What affects the Expensify Card limit?

- **Available funds:** A sudden drop in your linked bank account can reduce your Domain Limit.
- **Pending expenses:** Large, unprocessed purchases temporarily reduce your spending capacity.
- **Processing settlements:** Until the previous cycle settles, your limit adjusts dynamically.
