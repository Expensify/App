# Common reasons your Expensify Card might not work

If your card is declined or showing as inactive, it’s usually due to one of the following:

### Your card hasn’t been activated
- On your account homepage, you’ll see an **Activate your Expensify Card** task.
- Follow the prompt and enter the last 4 digits of your card to activate it. 

### You’ve hit your Smart Limit
Your Smart Limit is the amount you’re allowed to spend without approved expenses. If you try to make a purchase that exceeds this limit, the transaction will be declined. This limit is set and managed by your workspace admin.
To view your current limit:

 1. From the navigation tabs (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), select Account > Wallet.
 2. Click your Expensify Card to view your Smart Limit.

### Your card is Inactive 
- This means the the card has been canceled, or has been set a $0 limit by a workspace admin. 
- Contact your Workspace Admin to check your card status, or reach out to Concierge for help 

### There’s an issue with your workspace’s limit
- Each workspace has a shared **domain limit** that affects all cards.
- If the domain limit runs out, everyone’s card may temporarily stop working.
- This can happen if large purchases haven’t settled yet or if there’s a bank issue. Contact your workspace admin for help with this.

# Steps you can take to fix card problems

## If you’re a cardholder:
- Go to `Account > Wallet > Expensify Card`

# What do terms like "INACTIVE" or "Smart Limit inactive" mean?

- **INACTIVE**: Your card hasn’t been activated yet, or it was paused due to an issue (like a failed settlement or zero spending limit).
- **Smart Limit inactive**: The card exists, but there’s no available spending — either due to a $0 limit or no funds in the workspace’s overall domain limit.
