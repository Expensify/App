# FAQ

## How am I protected from fraud?

Expensify utilizes advanced algorithms to identify unusual card activity and provides real-time notifications for every charge made on your card.

## How long does the dispute process take?

The dispute process can take up to **90 days**.

## Can I cancel a dispute?

Yes, you can cancel a filed dispute by messaging Concierge or your Account Manager via Expensify Chat.

## What is a Visa Force-Posted Transaction?

A **Visa Force-Posted** transaction happens when a merchant manually finalizes a charge after an initial authorization fails, expires, or is declined. This means the merchant pushed the transaction through outside the standard authorization flow.

**Common reasons a Visa Force Posted transaction occurs:**
- A restaurant or hotel added a tip or final amount after the card was declined
- A gas station preauthorization expired, but the merchant finalized the sale anyway
- A merchant was experiencing technical issues and bypassed authorization

**Can I dispute a Force Posted transaction?**  
Yes, but the process depends on whether the charge is fraudulent or a service issue:
- If the charge is **fraudulent or unauthorized**, report it immediately by following the fraud dispute steps above
- If the charge is due to a **billing error or service issue**, follow the service dispute steps and provide documentation (like receipts or email confirmations) to help resolve the case

**Note:** Force-Posted transactions can be more complex to investigate, so it's helpful to contact the merchant directly before starting a dispute.
