Admins can assign and manage all corporate cards — both assigned and unassigned — from a single streamlined view in New Expensify. Updating in bulk makes it easier and faster to assign cards, especially when managing dozens or hundreds at once.


## How to assign a card

1. Go to your workspaces.
2. Select **[Workspace Name] > Copmpany cards**.
3. Locate the card you want to assign.
4. Select the `Assign` option in the row.
5. Select which employee you want to assign the card to.
  - **Note:** If you're assigning a card to a new employee, or one without an Expensify account, you can invite them during card assignment. Please note that this may result in an increase in your bill depending on the number of available seats you have.
6. Review the details to ensure it looks correct.
  - Note: you can choose a custom start date for the feed to begin by selecting `Start transaction date`, otherwise we default to today's date. 
  - Note: you can also choose to update the card name by selecting `Card name`, inputting the new name, and selecting `Save`
7. Select `Confirm` to finalize the assignment.
9. If there’s an error, the row will display an alert icon and error message.

## What's Improved

- **Filter cards** by status: assigned vs. unassigned.
- **Search** by:
  - Employee name
  - Last 4 digits of the card
  - Card name (if available)
- **Sort columns** for faster organization and review.


## Example Use Cases

- Filter unassigned cards to quickly complete setup for new employees.
- Search for a specific card using the last four digits.
- Sort by employee to review card distribution across the team.


# FAQ
