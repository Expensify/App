Admins can assign and manage all corporate cards — both assigned and unassigned — from a single streamlined view in New Expensify. Updating in bulk makes it easier and faster to assign cards, especially when managing dozens or hundreds at once.


# Assign Company Cards

1. Go to your workspaces.
2. Select **[Workspace Name] > Company cards**.
3. If you have multiple card feeds in your workspace, click the feed name at the top left to select the correct one.
4. Click **Assign card** next to the card you want to assign. You can filter by card number or name above the card list to make it easier to find a specific card.
5. Select which employee you want to assign the card to.
  - **Note:** If you're assigning a card to a new employee, or one without an Expensify account, you can invite them during card assignment. Please note that this may result in an increase in your bill depending on the number of available seats you have.
6. Review the details to ensure it looks correct.
  - **Note:** You can choose to either import cards using a custom transaction start date or from the beginning, which imports transactions as far back as available. Most company card feeds can import 30-90 days of historical transactions, depending on the bank.
7. Click **Confirm** to finalize the assignment.

# Manage Assigned Cards

After assigning cards to users, you can manage those assigned cards from the same page. To find a card:
- Filter cards to assigned cards, unassigned cards, or all cards.
- Search by employee name/email, last 4 digits of the card, or custom card name.
- Sort columns for faster organization and review.

**Available actions:**
- Rename the card  
- Assign a specific export account  
- Update transactions  (to manually import newer transactions)
- Unassign the card

**Note:** Unassigning a card will delete unsubmitted expenses from draft reports for that cardholder.
