# Commercial Card Feeds 

Commercial card feeds are file-based connections provided directly by your bank. Unlike direct feeds, which require you to log in with your bank credentials, commercial feeds are managed by your bank and typically used for large-scale corporate card programs. Contact your bank directly to check if your cards are eligible for a commercial feed.

## Who can use Commercial Card Feeds

- **Collect plan** members can add one commercial card feed.
- **Control plan** members can add an unlimited number of company card feeds.
- Workspace creation is required before connecting cards.

# FAQ

## What’s the difference between a commercial feed and a direct feed?

- **Direct feeds** connect using your bank login credentials. They’re quick to set up but may require periodic re-authentication.
- **Commercial feeds** are bank-managed file connections. They require setup through your bank but offer a **more stable and uninterrupted** connection.

## My feed is connected, but I don’t see my card. What now?

Cards will only appear if:
- They are active
- At least one transaction has posted

If a card still isn’t showing, contact your account manager or email [concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com).

## Is there an extra cost for commercial feeds?

No. Commercial feeds are included in the Collect and Control plans:
- **Collect** includes one commercial feed.
- **Control** supports unlimited feeds.
