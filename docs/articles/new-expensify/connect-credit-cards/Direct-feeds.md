Direct feeds offer a fast and reliable way to import company card transactions. By connecting your bank to Expensify using your credentials, you can be up and running in just a few minutes.

You can add one **direct** or [**commercial feed**](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/connect-credit-cards/Commercial-feeds) on the **Collect plan**. Upgrade to the **Control plan** to add unlimited company cards.

# FAQ

## My Direct Feed Is Connected. Why Isn’t a Specific Card Showing Up?

Make sure you use the master credentials when connecting. Cards must be active and have at least one recent transaction to appear. If issues persist, contact your account manager or email [concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com).

---

## Are Direct Feeds the Best Option?

If Expensify supports your bank, direct feeds are a fast and convenient setup.  
For **greater stability**, consider a [commercial feed](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/connect-credit-cards/Commercial-feeds) or use the [Expensify Card](https://use.expensify.com/company-credit-card).

---

## Is There an Extra Fee?

No.  
- One direct feed is included in the **Collect plan**.  
- Add more by upgrading to the **Control plan**.

## What’s the Difference Between Direct and Commercial Feeds?

| Feature            | Direct Feed                  | Commercial Feed               |
|--------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Setup              | User credentials (login)     | Bank-initiated (no login)      |
| Stability          | May require reauthentication | Most reliable connection       |
| Bank involvement   | Not required                 | Required                       |

## What If Expensify Doesn’t Support My Bank?

If your bank isn’t supported for direct feeds, consider:

- Setting up a [commercial feed](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/connect-credit-cards/Commercial-feeds)
- Using the [Expensify Card](https://use.expensify.com/company-credit-card)

Supported banks for direct feeds include:

- American Express  
- Bank of America  
- Brex  
- Capital One  
- Chase  
- Citibank  
- Stripe  
- Wells Fargo

---

## Can Direct Feeds Have Downtime?

Occasionally, yes. Bank security updates can interrupt connections. Expensify’s engineering team monitors these and works to restore access quickly.

---

## My Direct Feed Is Broken. How Do I Fix It?

If login credentials, card numbers, or security questions have changed:

1. Go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Company Cards**
2. Click **Log into your bank** on the error message
3. Reauthenticate to restore the connection

---

## Can I Connect Multiple Direct Feeds from the Same Bank?

No. Each workspace supports **one direct feed per bank**. If you have multiple programs, request that your bank consolidate them under one login. You can connect multiple direct feeds from **different banks** in the same workspace.
