# Overview
Direct feeds are a quick and reliable way to import company card expenses. Connect your bank to Expensify with your login credentials to be up and running in minutes!

# Prerequisites for enabling a direct feed 
If you haven't already, you need to create a workspace before setting up a direct feed. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > New workspace** to create one.
Additionally, you’ll need to enable company cards on your workspace by navigating to **Settings > Workspaces > [your workspace] > More features**, and toggling on **Company cards**. Note that upgrading to the Control plan is required to access this feature.
# How to set up a direct feed
After creating a Control workspace, you can add a direct feed by going to **Settings > Workspaces > [your workspace] > Company cards** and selecting **Add cards**.

Select your bank from the list. If your bank isn’t there, check out [commercial feeds](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/connect-credit-cards/company-cards/Commercial-feeds).

Select **Direct feed**.

Log into your bank’s website using the master credentials (typically those of the account owner with the highest-level access), then follow the steps to select your account(s) and connect them to Expensify.

# How to assign company cards
Once your feed is connected, you can assign cards to employees. To do this, navigate to **Settings > Workspaces > [your workspace] > Company cards**.

Select the card you want to assign. Cards only appear if they have recent transactions.

Choose a start date:
- **From the beginning**: Imports all available transactions (typically 30-90 days).
- **Custom start date**: Allows you to specify a date.

# Managing cards 
Clicking an assigned card opens the **Card details** page, where you can:

- Change the card name.
- Select a card-specific export account (if connected to accounting software like QuickBooks, NetSuite, Xero, etc.).
- Update the card to pull recent transactions.
- Unassign the card (note: unassigning deletes unsubmitted expenses on draft reports in the cardholder’s account).

## My direct feed is connected. Why is a specific card not appearing for assignment?
Make sure you used your bank's master credentials when connecting. Also, note that cards will only appear for assignment if they’re active and have at least one recent transaction. If a card meeting these conditions doesn’t appear, reach out to your account manager or email concierge@expensify.com.
 
## Are direct bank connections the best option for connecting credit cards to Expensify?
Direct bank connections are a great option if Expensify supports your bank. For enhanced stability and added functionality, consider setting up a [commercial feed](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/connect-credit-cards/company-cards/Commercial-feeds) with your bank or using the [Expensify Card](https://use.expensify.com/company-credit-card).

## Is there an extra fee for using direct feeds? 
No, direct feeds are included with the Control plan at no additional cost.

## What’s the difference between a direct feed and commercial feed? 
Direct feeds use login credentials for quick setup, but can require re-authentication from time to time. Commercial feeds require bank involvement for setup but offer the most reliable connection.

## What if Expensify doesn’t support direct feeds for my bank?
If direct feeds aren’t available for your bank, commercial feeds are the best option for importing company card transactions. Currently, Expensify supports direct feeds for:
- American Express
- Bank of America
- Brex
- Capital One
- Chase
- Citibank
- Stripe
- Wells Fargo
  
## Can direct feeds have maintenance/downtime?
Yes, occasionally. Banks may update their systems to enhance security, which can temporarily affect connections. Expensify’s engineering team works closely with banks to monitor and promptly update connections as needed.

## My direct feed connection is broken, how do I fix it?
Direct feed connections may break if your bank login credentials, card numbers, or security questions change. To fix this, go to **Settings > Workspaces > [your workspace] > Company cards** > select **log into your bank** on the error message and follow the steps to fix the connection.

## Can I connect several direct feeds with the same bank on one workspace?
No, only one direct feed per bank can be connected to a workspace. If you have multiple card programs with the same bank under different credentials, request that your bank consolidate them under one set of credentials. This allows you to connect all card programs through a single direct feed.

You can, however, connect multiple direct feeds to a workspace if they’re from different banks.
