Direct feeds in Expensify provide a fast, reliable way to import company card transactions. You can also use Plaid to connect your company card program, giving you even more options to manage your corporate card account directly in Expensify.

You can add one **direct** or [**commercial feed**](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/connect-credit-cards/Commercial-feeds) on the **Collect plan**. Upgrade to the **Control plan** to add unlimited company cards.

# Prerequisites

**A workspace on the Collect or Control plan:** Before setting up a direct feed, go to **Workspaces > New Workspace** to create a workspace (if you haven't already).

# Set Up a Direct Feed

1. . Go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Company cards** to view your company’s card setup page.
2. Click **Add cards** to start connecting a new feed.
3. **Select your country** from the list.  
   - Expensify will prefill this based on your workspace’s currency, but you can manually change it if needed.  
   - You won’t be able to continue without selecting a country -- You'll see an error.  
   
4. **Choose your feed type** when prompted:
   - **Direct feed** – This is the default option in most supported countries and works for the majority of users.  
   - **Commercial feed** – Best for large-scale card programs where your bank facilitates the connection directly.
5. **Pick your bank:**
   - If you’re in the U.S., select your bank from the list or choose **Other** to see additional banks supported by Plaid.
   - For international members in supported countries, choosing **Direct feed** will automatically launch the Plaid connection process.
