# Manage personal cards in New Expensify

Expensify lets you view and manage your personal credit cards in one place, making it easier to track spending, submit reimbursable expenses, and stay organized for tax time.

If you previously connected a personal card in Expensify Classic, you can now manage that card directly in Expensify on both web and mobile.

## Who can manage personal cards

# FAQ

## Can I add another personal card?

Not yet. Only cards connected to your account in Expensify Classic are available to manage in New Expensify. Support for adding new personal cards will be available in a future update.

## Can I change the reimbursable setting for past transactions?

No. Changes to the reimbursable setting only apply to transactions imported after the change. 

## Why don’t I see my personal card in the Wallet?

Personal cards appear in the Wallet only if they were previously connected to your account in Expensify Classic. If your card doesn’t show up, it means it wasn’t connected before and isn’t available to manage yet.
