# Overview

Expensify makes it easy to track expenses and get reimbursed by linking your personal credit card. Once connected, transactions can be imported automatically, or you can upload a CSV file for manual entry. These transactions will be merged with SmartScanned receipts and, if enabled, can generate IRS-compliant eReceipts.
