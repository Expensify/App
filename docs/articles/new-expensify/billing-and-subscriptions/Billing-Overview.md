This article explains how billing works in Expensify, including how charges are calculated, how to save money, and how to manage your billing ownership.

# How Expensify Billing Works

At the start of each month, the **Billing Owner** of a Group Workspace is charged for the previous monthâ€™s activity.

Your monthly bill depends on:
- The number of **active members**
- Your plan: **Collect** or **Control**
- Your billing type: **annual subscription** or **pay-per-use** 
- Whether you use the **Expensify VisaÂ® Commercial Card**

An **active member** is anyone who:
- Creates, submits, approves, reimburses, or exports a report
- Includes Copilots and any automated actions by Concierge

You can find your billing receipts under:
**Settings > Account > Subscription > Billing History**

**Note:** We recommend having just one Billing Owner per Group Workspace to simplify account management.

# Save Money on Expensify

ðŸ’¸ **Highest Discount: Annual + Expensify Card**: Pair an **annual subscription** with the **Expensify Card** to get the lowest pricing. 

If at least **50%** of your total settled US spend in a month is on the Expensify Card, you'll qualify for the **best price**:
- **Collect Plan:** $5 per active member/month  
- **Control Plan:** $9 per active member/month

**Additional Cash Back:**
- **1% cash back** on all Expensify Card purchases  
- **2% cash back** if total US spend on the card is $250,000+ per month

Cashback is first applied to your Expensify bill. Any remaining balance is deposited into your bank account.

# Subscription Types

## Annual

Get **50% off** with an annual commitment:

| Plan        | Annual Rate (per active member/month) |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Collect     | $10                                    |
| Control     | $18                                    |

If your subscription size exceeds the limit, extra members are charged at the **pay-per-use rate** for that month.

You can increase your subscription size anytime (which extends your annual term). You can **only decrease** it when your current term ends.

## Pay-per-use

This pay-as-go plan charges the full rate and is billed monthly:

| Plan        | Pay-per-use Rate (per active member/month)         |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Collect     | $5 (intro rate for new users; conditions apply)     |
| Collect     | $20 (standard rate)                                 |
| Control     | $36                                                 |

# Transfer Billing Ownership

2. From their account, go to:
   **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members**
3. Click the current Workspace Ownerâ€™s name and select **Transfer Ownership**.
4. The new Billing Owner will be prompted to:

   - Take over billing starting the next month
