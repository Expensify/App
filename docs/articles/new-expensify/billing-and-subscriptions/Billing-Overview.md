title: Billing and Subscriptions
description: Expensify Billing Overview
---

At the beginning of each month, the workspace's Billing Owner is billed for the previous month’s activity. 
Your Expensify bill is determined by the following: 
- The number of active members in your workspace
- Whether you have a Collect or Control plan
- Whether you’re on pay-per-use or an annual subscription
- Whether you’re using the Expensify Visa® Commercial Card

An active member is any member who creates, submits, approves, reimburses, or exports a report in Expensify in a given month. This includes Copilots and automatic actions by Concierge.

Your billing receipts can be viewed under **Settings** > **Account** > **Payments** > **Billing History**. We recommend appointing a single billing owner for each Group Workspace.

# Save Money on Your Expensify Bill

## Annual Subscription + Expensify Card

Save the most money on Expensify by pairing an annual subscription with the Expensify Visa® Commercial Card. Then, if at least 50% of your total settled US spend in a given month is on the Expensify Card, you’ll pay the best possible price for Expensify:

- **Collect Plan:** $5 per active member per month 
- **Control Plan:** $9 per active member per month

**You also get cash back!** Earn 1% cash back on all Expensify Card purchases or 2% if card spending reaches $250,000 or more monthly (for US purchases only). Cash back first applies to your Expensify bill, with any remainder deposited directly into your bank account.

Use Expensify’s [savings calculator](https://use.expensify.com/resource-center/tools/savings-calculator) to see your potential savings with the Expensify Card. 

## Annual Subscription vs Pay-per-use

**Annual Subscription**

You get a 50% discount with an annual subscription:

- **Collect Plan:** $10 per active member per month 
- **Control Plan:** $18 per active member per month
  
If your active members exceed your subscription size, additional members are billed at the pay-per-use rate for that month. You can increase your subscription size at any time (extending your annual term) but can only reduce it once your current subscription period ends.

**Pay-per-use**

Rates for pay-per-use plans are applied at full price:

- **Collect plan:** $20 per active member per month
- **Control plan:** $36 per active member per month

## Transfer Ownership of Billing

If another member needs to own the billing on a given workspace, they must first be a Workspace Admin. Then, from their account, the Admin will head to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members** > click on the current workspace owner > select **Transfer Ownership**.

From there, the new billing owner will add a payment card and be charged for the member activity on the workspace on the first of the month.
