## Subscription Overview

This is where you can view your current subscription plan and see details like the number of seats, billing information, and the next renewal date.

**Subscription Settings**:
   - **Auto-renew**: See when your subscription will automatically renew (e.g., **Renews on Nov 1, 2024**).
- **Auto-increase annual seats**: Here you can see how much you could save by automatically increasing seats to accommodate team members who exceed the current subscription size.

**Note**: This will extend your annual subscription end date.

**Note**: Not all customers are eligible to cancel their subscription early.
