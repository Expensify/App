# FAQ

## When my workspace is deleted, will my expenses be deleted?

No. Expensify retains your expenses and reports even if your workspace is deleted. Your data is only removed if you close your entire Expensify account.

## Can I reopen a deleted workspace?

No. Once a workspace is deleted, it cannot be reopened or reactivated. To use Expensify again with a group setup, you'll need to create a new workspace.

## What happens to company cards if I delete a workspace?

Deleting a workspace will permanently remove workspace-specific settings like company cards. However, your expenses and reports will remain unless you close your Expensify account entirely.
