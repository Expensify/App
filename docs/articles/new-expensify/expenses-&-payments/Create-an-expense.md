Expenses can be created through SmartScanning a receipt, emailing a receipt, tracking distance, and manually creating an expense. 

They can be submitted to an individual or a workspace. Before we outline the steps to create an expense, let’s go over the reasons to send an expense to an individual or a workspace. 

# Sending an expense to an Individual 

If you use Expensify for personal use, submitting to an individual is likely best. 

Once the expense is created, you will see the option to send it to an email or phone number. Alternatively, add an expense to a chat, which will go straight to the person you are chatting with.

When an expense is submitted to an individual’s email or phone number, the payor will receive an email or text notification with the amount that needs to be paid. They can click on the amount in the email or text to pay the expense.

# Submit an expense to a workspace or employer

If you are an employee or a workspace member, you should submit the expense to the workspace instead of an individual. A workspace is designed to code expenses to the company's requirements. 

When an expense is submitted to a workspace, your approver will receive an email or text notification prompting them to approve and pay it.
