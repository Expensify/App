3. Choose the next steps for the expense:
   - **Submit it to someone**: Select this option to request payment from other members of your Expensify workspace. 
   - **Categorize it**: Select this option to choose a category and additional details to code the expense for a specific workspace. The expense will then be placed on a report and can be submitted to the workspace for approval. 
   - **Share it with my accountant**: Select this option to share the expense with your accountant. The expense will then be placed on a report under the workspace for your accountant to review.
   - **Nothing for now**: Select this option to store the expense. Expensify will keep the expense until you are ready to take action on it—it won’t expire. When you’re ready, you can then select one of the above options for the expense at a later time.
