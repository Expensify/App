Expenses can be created through manual entry, tracking distance, or scanning a receipt. They can be submitted to an individual or a workspace. 

This help article has more details about creating and submitting an expense to an individual or a workspace. 

# Receiving an expense from an Individual

When an expense is submitted to an individual, it doesn’t need approval. It only needs to be paid. 

This help article has the steps to pay the expense. 

# Receiving a workspace expense

When an expense is submitted to a workspace with an “approval workflow”, it must be approved before it can be paid.

As a workspace admin, you can set an [approval workflow](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/workspaces/Add-approvals) in the workspace settings. For each expense report, you’ll have the option to: 

- **Approve:** Click Approve if you’re satisfied with the expense details.
- **Hold the expense:** If you need to delay a payment or provide more information before approval, you can hold an expense.
- **Unapprove the expense:** You can return the expense to the submitter for revisions.

Reports that have been paid cannot be unapproved. 

If the approved expense has already been exported to an accounting package, you’ll see a warning that unapproving an expense can cause data discrepancies and Expensify Card reconciliation issues. Ideally, you’ll want to delete the data already exported to the accounting package before approving the expense again.

**Why is an employee expense showing as ‘pending?’**

An Expensify Card expense will show as pending if the merchant hasn’t posted it. This is usually the case with hotel holds, or card rental holds. A hold will normally last no more than 7-10 business days unless it’s a hotel hold, which can last 31 days. 

**What are expense reports?**

In Expensify, expense reports group expenses in a batch to be paid or reconciled. When a draft report is open, all new expenses are added to it. 

Once a report is submitted, you can track the status from the **Search** section. Click the **View** button for a specific expense or expense report. The status is displayed at the top of the expense or report.
