# How the customer pays an invoice

Once an invoice is sent, the customer receives an automated email or text message to notify them of the invoice. They can use this notification to pay the invoice whenever they are ready. They will: 

1. Click the link in the email or text notification they receive from Expensify. 
2. Click **Pay**.
3. Choose **Paying as an individual** or **Paying as a business**.
4. Click **Pay Elsewhere**, which will mark the invoice as Paid. 

Currently, invoices must be paid outside of Expensify. However, the ability to make payments through Expensify is coming soon.

# FAQs

**How do I communicate with the sender/recipient about the invoice?**

You can communicate with the recipient in New Expensify. After sending an invoice, Expensify automatically creates an invoice room between the invoice sender and the payer to discuss anything related to the invoice. You can invite users to join the conversation, remove them from the room, and leave the room at any time. 

**Can you import and export invoices between an accounting integration?**

Yes, you can export and import invoices between Expensify and your QuickBooks Online or Xero integration.
