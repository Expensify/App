# Receive invoice payment 

If you have not [connected a business bank account](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expenses-&-payments/Connect-a-Business-Bank-Account) to receive invoice payments, you will see an **Invoice balance** in your [Wallet](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expenses-&-payments/Set-up-your-wallet). Expensify will automatically transfer these invoice payments once a business bank account is connected.

**Why do I need to create a workspace to send an invoice?**

A workspace is a configuration of settings related to your business. Since invoicing is considered a business feature, you must have a workspace to configure and use invoicing.

**How do I communicate with the sender/recipient about the invoice?**

Expensify will automatically notify the invoice recipient about the new invoice via email, SMS, and a mobile app notification, along with instructions on how to pay it. Daily reminders will be sent until the invoice is paid. 

Additionally, an invoice chat room will be automatically created in Expensify between the invoice sender, their workspace admins, and the payer. You can use this chat to discuss anything related to the invoice. 

**Can you export invoices between an accounting integration?**

Yes, you can export invoices between Expensify and your connected [accounting integration](https://help.expensify.com/new-expensify/hubs/connections/). 

**Who can send and pay an invoice?**

All workspace admins will be able to send and pay invoices. Invoices can also be paid by anyone, including recipients without an Expensify account.  

**What happens if I disable invoicing in the future?**

When invoicing is disabled, all previously created invoice rooms and historical invoices will remain unaffected and continue to exist. However, all workspace admins will no longer have the option to send an invoice. 

**Why am I getting an error after I enter my website when connecting a business bank account?**

We can only accept a private domain website to ensure the security of your business. If you receive an error when entering your website, it is likely because the domain is not recognized as private. Make sure you are using a business email with a private domain. If you continue to experience issues, contact our support team at concierge@expensify.com for further assistance.
