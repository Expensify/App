# How to create a Per Diem expense

If your workspace has **Per Diem** enabled, you can create a Per Diem expense directly from the **Submit Expense** flow. Follow the steps below to complete the process.

## Submitting a Per Diem expense

### 1. Open the expense submission flow
- Tap **Submit Expense** from the **Global Create** menu.
- If your workspace has **Per Diem** enabled, you’ll see the **Per Diem** option.

> **Note:** If you're submitting an expense from a group chat or DM (outside a workspace), you won’t see the **Per Diem** option.

### 2. Select a workspace
- If you are a member of multiple workspaces with Per Diem enabled, select the workspace you want to submit the expense under.
- If you only belong to one workspace with Per Diem enabled, this step will be skipped.

### 3. Choose a destination
- Select the country or region where the Per Diem expense applies.

### 4. Enter time details
- Set the **Start Date** and **Start Time**.
- Set the **End Date** and **End Time**.

### 5. Select your Per Diem sub-rate
- Choose a **sub-rate** (e.g., Full day, Breakfast, Dinner).
- Enter the **quantity** (e.g., the number of days or meals covered).

### 6. Review and adjust details
- You can go back and update any previous selections.
- Add more **sub-rates** if needed (e.g., if your trip includes multiple types of expenses).
- Optionally, add a **category, tag, or description** to your expense.

### 7. Submit the Per Diem expense
- Once everything is correct, tap **Submit Expense**.
