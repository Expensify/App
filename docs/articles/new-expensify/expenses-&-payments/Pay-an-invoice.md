# FAQ

**Can someone else pay an invoice besides the person who received it?**

No, only the person who received the invoice will see the option to pay it.

Anyone can pay an invoice they’ve received, but only Expensify customers can send an invoice. This feature ensures that businesses using Expensify can seamlessly manage their invoice billing processes while providing flexibility for their customers to make payments.
