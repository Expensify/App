Copilots can access another Expensify user’s account directly from their own Expensify account to:

- View all expenses and chats visible from the other user’s account
- Prepare expenses on their behalf
- Approve and reimburse expense reports submitted to them
- View and make changes to their account, domain, and workspace settings

Copilots **cannot** add additional Copilots.

# Act as a Copilot

**To switch accounts:**

1. Click your profile icon in the bottom left corner to open Settings
2. Click the up-down arrow next to your profile name in the top left corner to access the account switcher
3. Select the account you'd like to switch to. Each account will show the level of access you've been granted.

A dual avatar displays in the bottom left corner to confirm that you are in Copilot mode.

# Forward an email receipt as a Copilot
If you have been added to another user's account as their Copilot, you can forward email receipts to their account from your own email.

1. Forward the email receipt
2. Add receipts@expensify.com to the To: field
3. For the email’s subject line, enter the email address of the account you are a Copilot for. This ensures the receipt is routed to the correct Expensify account.
4. Send the email

# FAQ

## As a Copilot, can I add or remove other Copilots?
No. Copilots are restricted from adding or removing Copilots from other accounts. Only the account owner can add or remove Copilots from their own account. The only exception is that Copilots can remove themselves from another user's account.

## How can I tell which actions were taken by a Copilot?
Any action taken by a Copilot will be displayed as being taken by the Copilot on behalf of the account owner.

## Can I have more than one Copilot?
You can assign as many Copilots as you need—there is no limit. However, you can only add one Copilot per minute.
