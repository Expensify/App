Copilots can access another Expensify user’s account directly from their own Expensify account to:

- View all expenses and chats visible from the other user’s account
- Prepare expenses on their behalf
- Approve and reimburse expense reports submitted to them
- View and make changes to their account, domain, and workspace settings

Copilots **cannot** add additional Copilots.

A dual avatar displays in the bottom left corner to confirm that you are in Copilot mode.

If you have been added to another user's account as their Copilot, you can forward email receipts to their account from your own email.

1. Forward the email receipt
2. Add receipts@expensify.com to the To: field
3. For the email’s subject line, enter the email address of the account you are a Copilot for. This ensures the receipt is routed to the correct Expensify account.
4. Send the email

# FAQ

## As a Copilot, can I add or remove other Copilots?
No. Copilots are restricted from adding or removing Copilots from other accounts. Only the account owner can add or remove Copilots from their own account. The only exception is that Copilots can remove themselves from another user's account.

## How can I tell which actions were taken by a Copilot?
Any action taken by a Copilot will be displayed as being taken by the Copilot on behalf of the account owner.

## Can I have more than one Copilot?
You can assign as many Copilots as you need—there is no limit. However, you can only add one Copilot per minute.
