The default email address on your Expensify account is the email that receives email updates and notifications for your account. You can add additional contact methods in order to
- Change your default email to a new one.
- Connect your personal email address as an additional way to log in if your default email address is one from your employer. This allows you to always have access to your Expensify account, even if your employer changes. 

{% include info.html %}
Before you can remove a default email address, you must add a new one to your Expensify account and make it the default using the steps below. Email addresses must be added as a contact method before they can be made the default.
