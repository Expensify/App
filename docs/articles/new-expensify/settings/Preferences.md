# How to set your theme preference in New Expensify

To set or update your theme preference in New Expensify: 
1. Go to **Settings > Preferences**
2. Tap on **Theme**
3. You can choose between the _Dark_ theme, the _Light_ theme, or _Use Device Settings_

_Use Device Settings_ is the default setting.

Selecting _Use Device Settings_ will use your device's theme settings. For example, if your device is set to adjust the appearance from light to dark during the day, we'll match that.

Your theme preference will sync across all your New Expensify apps (mobile, web, or OSX desktop apps).
