# How to avoid scams pretending to be from Expensify

Some scammers try to impersonate Expensify by sending fake emails or calling you directly, often asking for your **Magic Code** (your login code). These scams are designed to trick you into giving up access to your Expensify account.

This guide explains what these scams look like, how to spot them, and what to do if you think you've been targeted.

## What is the Magic Code?

The **Magic Code** is a one-time login code Expensify emails or texts to you when you sign in without a password. It should only be used by **you** during login.

**Expensify will never call, email, or message you to ask for your Magic Code.**

## Common scams to watch out for

Here are the most common types of scams we've seen targeting Expensify members:

### 1. Phone call scams requesting your Magic Code

- The scammer claims to be from Expensify and needs your Magic Code to verify your account.
- They may spoof a legitimate phone number to make it seem more convincing.
- Some scammers may create a sense of urgency (e.g., “We detected suspicious activity on your account.”)

**If someone calls you asking for your Magic Code, hang up immediately.**

### 2. Phishing emails and texts requesting you use their link to login to Expensify

- Emails and text messages often look like they’re from Expensify or Visa, but the sender address is likely not from an expensify.com email address.
- These emails and text messages may have links that lead to a fake login page, prompt you to reset your password, or ask you to reply with your Magic Code.
- Scammers sometimes use urgent language like “Your account will be closed if you don’t respond.”

**Don’t click suspicious links, and never share your Magic Code in email. Expensify will only generate a magic code for you when you take an action in the app, such as logging in or making a high-risk change.**

## How to stay safe

Here’s how you can protect your Expensify account:

- **Never share your Magic Code** — not over the phone, not by email, not via text.
- **Don’t click suspicious links** — always verify the sender’s email address.
- **Use 2FA** (two-factor authentication) to add an extra layer of security.
- **If in doubt, message Concierge** directly from within the Expensify app.

Legitimate Expensify emails always come from an address ending in **@expensify.com** or **@team.expensify.com**. If you’re unsure, don’t click any links — just log into the Expensify app directly and message Concierge.

Expensify will **never** call you asking for login codes, passwords, or payment information. If you receive such a call, it's a scam.
