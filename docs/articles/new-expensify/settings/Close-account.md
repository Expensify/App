Closing your account will delete the data associated with the account. However, transactions shared with other accounts, including approved and reimbursed company expenses, will still be visible under those accounts. We may also be required to retain certain transaction records in compliance with laws in various jurisdictions.

**I’m unable to close my account.**

If your account has an outstanding balance or if you have been assigned a role under a company’s Expensify workspace, you may encounter an error message during the account closure process, or the Close Account button may not be available. Here are the steps to follow for each scenario:

- **Account Under a Validated Domain**: A Domain Admin must remove your account from the domain. Then you will be able to successfully close your account.
- **Sole Domain Admin**: If you are the only Domain Admin for a company’s domain, you must assign a new Domain Admin before you can close your account.
- **Workspace Billing Owner with an annual subscription**: You must downgrade from the annual subscription before closing the account. Alternatively, you can have another user take over billing for your workspaces.
- **Company Workspace Owner**: You must assign a new workspace owner before you can close your account.
- **Account has an outstanding balance**: You must make a payment to resolve the outstanding balance before you can close your account.
- **Preferred Exporter for a workspace integration**: You must assign a new Preferred Exporter before closing your account.
- **Verified Business Account that is locked**: You must unlock the account.
- **Verified Business Account that has an outstanding balance**: You must make a payment to settle any outstanding balances before the account can be closed.
- **Unverified account**: You must first verify your account before it can be closed.
