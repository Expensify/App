# FAQ

## Can a Copilot Add or Remove Other Copilots?

No. Copilots can’t add or remove others. Only the account owner can manage Copilots, though a Copilot can remove themselves.

## How Are Copilot Actions Tracked?

Actions taken by a Copilot are clearly labeled as performed “on behalf of” the account owner in Expensify.

## Can I Have Multiple Copilots?

Yes! You can add as many Copilots as you like. (You just need to wait one minute between additions.)
