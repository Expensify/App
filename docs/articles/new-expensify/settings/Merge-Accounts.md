# Merge Accounts

If you have two Expensify accounts (e.g., a personal account and a separate company account), you can combine them by merging. This process consolidates all receipts, expenses, reports, invoices, bills, imported cards, secondary logins, co-pilots, and group workspace settings into one account.

> **Merging accounts is permanent and cannot be undone.** To merge a company and personal account, log in to your company account and merge your personal account with it.

### Restrictions
- You cannot merge a company account into a personal account.
- You cannot merge two company accounts if they belong to private domains.
- If your company has SAML enabled, you’ll be prompted to **Switch to Classic** for your domain admin to approve the request.
