The locked account tool blocks access to high-risk features when an account is suspected to be compromised. It prevents unauthorized actions and protects sensitive account and payment functions.

---

## When is it appropriate to click the button for your own account or for your employee’s account?

Click the **Lock Account** button if:
- Your account is compromised (e.g., unexpected logins or changes).
- An employee's account appears at risk.
- Suspicious actions like changing contact methods or adding payment methods occur.

Locking the account restricts critical permissions and alerts Concierge to review the situation.

## How to do it?

## Unlocking an account

This button is not reversible without the assistance of an Expensify team member. Once the account is locked, a member of the Expensify team will work with you to take the necessary steps to secure your account and remove any unauthorised access. Only once these steps are taken will the account be unlocked.
