The Lock Account tool blocks access to high-risk features when an account is suspected to be compromised. It protects sensitive data by preventing unauthorized actions and triggering internal review by the Expensify team.

# When to Use the Lock Account Button

Click the **Lock Account** button if:

- You believe your own account has been compromised (e.g., suspicious logins, changes to contact info, or unfamiliar devices).
- You’re a Workspace Admin and suspect an employee’s account is at risk.
- You notice unusual activity, such as new payment methods, security setting changes, or frequent failed login attempts.

Locking the account restricts access to sensitive features and alerts Concierge to review the account.

# How to Lock an Account

To lock your own account or an employee’s account:

1. Go to **Account > Security**.
2. Click **Lock Account**.

⚠️ **Important:** This action is not reversible from within the product. Once an account is locked, only Expensify Support can unlock it.

# How to Unlock an Account

Unlocking a locked account requires assistance from Expensify Support. Once you click **Lock Account**, Concierge will begin reviewing the account and contact you with the next steps. You may be asked to:

- Verify identity
- Reset login credentials
- Review recent activity
- Confirm that no unauthorized changes remain

Once security checks are completed, the Expensify team will unlock the account.

# FAQ

## Why can’t I unlock my account myself?

For your security, only Expensify Support can unlock an account. This prevents malicious users from reversing a lock if they’ve gained access. To get help, reach out to Concierge support via chat. We’ll respond as quickly as possible.
