If you're out of the office or on vacation, you can assign a **Vacation Delegate** to handle your approvals while you're away.

A **Vacation Delegate** can approve reports on your behalf. Once assigned, any reports sent to you for approval will be automatically redirected to your delegate. When you're back, just remove the delegate to resume handling your own reports.

All delegate actions are tracked in the report history for full visibility.

# FAQ

## Can my admin assign a Vacation Delegate for me?

No. In New Expensify, only you can assign your own Vacation Delegate.

## Why can't my Vacation Delegate reimburse reports?

Your delegate can only reimburse reports if they also have access to the reimbursement account in your workspace. Without access, they won't see the option to reimburse—even if they're your delegate.

## What if my delegate is also on vacation?

Your delegate can assign their own Vacation Delegate too. This ensures approvals keep moving, even when multiple members are away.

## If I clear my status, does that remove my Vacation Delegate?

No. Clearing your status won't affect your delegate. You'll need to manually remove them when you're back.

## What if my delegate isn’t in the same workspace?

If your delegate isn’t part of your workspace, Workspace Admins will be notified by email and prompted to add them.
