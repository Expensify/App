# Troubleshooting: Can’t Close Your Account?

If you're unable to close your account, it’s likely due to one of the following reasons:

- **You're under a validated domain**: A Domain Admin must remove you from the domain.
- **You're the only Domain Admin**: Assign a new Domain Admin before proceeding.
- **You're the billing owner on an annual subscription**: Downgrade or transfer billing to another user first.
- **You're a workspace owner**: Assign a new owner to the workspace.
- **Outstanding balance**: Settle any unpaid invoices.
- **You're the Preferred Exporter for an integration**: Assign a new Preferred Exporter before closing.
- **Your verified business account is locked**: Resolve the lock by contacting support.
- **Your verified business account has a balance due**: Make a payment to continue.
- **Your account is unverified**: You must verify the account before it can be closed.

If you're still having trouble, reach out to **Concierge** for additional assistance.
