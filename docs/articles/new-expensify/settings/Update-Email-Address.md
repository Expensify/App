# Why Add Another Email Address?

Adding an additional email helps you:

- **Switch your default email** to a new one (e.g., a personal address).
- **Maintain access** if your primary email is tied to an employer domain.
- **Use multiple logins**â€”emails and phone numbers can be used interchangeably to access your account.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** You must verify any new contact method before making it your default or removing the existing one.
