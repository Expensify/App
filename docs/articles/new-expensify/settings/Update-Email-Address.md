# Why Add Another Contact Method?

Adding an additional contact method helps you:

- **Switch your default email** to a new one (e.g., a personal address).
- **Maintain access** if your primary email is tied to an employer domain.
- **Use multiple logins**â€”emails and phone numbers can be used interchangeably to access your account.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** You must verify any new contact method before making it your default or removing the existing one.

# Add or Change a Contact Method

1. In the left-hand menu, click **Account > Profile**.
2. Under **Contact Method**, click **New Contact Method**.
3. Enter the email address or phone number you want to add.
4. Click **Add**.
5. Check your email or texts for a **verification code**, enter it in Expensify, and click **Verify**.

After verifying, click any contact method to:
- Set it as your **default**
- **Remove** it
- **Re-send verification**

# Important Notes

- You canâ€™t remove your default contact method until another verified contact method is set as default.
- You can add multiple contact methods for flexibility when logging in or recovering your account.
