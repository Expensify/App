Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection to your Expensify account. This guide covers setup, login expectations, recovery steps if you lose access, and admin override options.

# How two-factor authentication works

When logging in:
1. Enter your email and the magic code sent to your inbox.
2. Enter a 6-digit code generated by your authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Authy).

Codes refresh every few seconds. If one expires, simply open the app for a new code.

# How to enable two-factor authentication

1. From the left-hand menu, select **Account > Security**.
2. Under **Security options**, select **Two-Factor Authentication**.
3. Follow the prompts to enable 2FA.
4. **Save your backup codes**—these are essential for account recovery.  
   - Select **Download** to save the codes securely.  
   - Select **Copy** to paste them into a password manager or secure file.  
5. Open your authenticator app and connect it to Expensify by:  
   - Scanning the QR code, or  
   - Entering the setup code manually.  
6. Enter the 6-digit verification code and select **Verify**.

# What to expect when logging in

After setup, login requires both:
1. Your magic code (sent via email).  
2. The 6-digit verification code from your authenticator app.

# Recovery options

Backup recovery codes work like one-time passwords. They are your fastest recovery method if you lose access to your authenticator app.

**Tip:** Store unused recovery codes in a secure, offline location. Each code can only be used once.

## If you lost your device and have no recovery codes
- **Individual account**: If you're using a public domain (like gmail.com or outlook.com), you'll need to create a new Expensify account with a different email. Concierge can assist with transferring access to any shared Workspaces.  
- **Domain account**: A **Domain Admin** can reset your 2FA. Once reset, you’ll log in normally and set up 2FA again.

# Admin recovery and overrides

## If a Domain Admin is available
- Domain Admins can reset a member’s 2FA by going to:  
  **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Members > Security Settings**  
- Select the member, then disable their 2FA.  

## If the enforcing Domain Admin has left
1. Verify domain ownership by proving control of the domain’s email DNS or MX records.  
2. Assign a new Domain Admin in **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Domain Settings**.  
3. Once the new admin is assigned, follow the steps above to reset 2FA for affected members.

# Best practices

- Save your recovery codes as soon as you set up 2FA.  
- Consider adding 2FA on multiple devices (e.g., phone and tablet) during setup for backup.  
- Keep your device’s clock set to the correct time—codes depend on accurate timing.

# FAQ

## Why should I use 2FA?
It prevents unauthorized access, even if someone has your login email or password.

## What if I lose my phone or uninstall the app?
Use a recovery code to log in, then disable and re-enable 2FA on your new device.

## Can I use 2FA on more than one device?
Yes. Scan the setup QR code with multiple devices when enabling 2FA.

## What if my verification code isn’t working?
Check your device’s time settings. Authenticator apps rely on accurate system clocks.
