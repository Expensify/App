You can respond directly to a message sent in a chat group or room to start a private 1-on-1 chat with another member about the message (instead of replying to the entire group or room).

{% include option.html value="desktop" %}
1. Open the chat in your inbox.
2. Right-click the message and select **Reply in thread**. 
3. Enter and submit your reply in the new chat. 
{% include end-option.html %}

{% include option.html value="mobile" %}
1. Open the chat in your inbox.
2. Press and hold the message and select **Reply in thread**. 
3. Enter and submit your reply in the new chat. 
{% include end-option.html %}

{% include end-selector.html %}

To return to the conversation where the thread originated from, you can click the link at the top of the thread.
