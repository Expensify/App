# Admin Best Practices
In order to get the most out of Expensify Chat, we created a list of best practices for admins to review in order to use the tool to its fullest capabilities.

**During the conference:**
- At a minimum, send 3 announcements throughout the day to create awareness of any sessions, activations, contests, or parties you want to promote.
- Communicate with the Expensify Team in the #admins room if you see anything you have questions about or are unsure of to make sure we’re resolving issues together ASAP.
- As an admin, It’s up to you to help keep your conference community safe and respectful. [Flag any content for moderation](https://help.expensify.com/articles/other/Everything-About-Chat#flagging-content-as-offensive) that does not fit your culture and values to keep chatrooms a positive experience for everyone involved.

**After the conference:**
- The rooms will all stay open after the conference ends, so encourage speakers to keep engaging as long as the conversation is going in their session room.
- Continue sharing photos and videos from the event or anything fun in #social as part of a wrap up for everyone.
- Use the #announce room to give attendees a sneak preview of your next event.
