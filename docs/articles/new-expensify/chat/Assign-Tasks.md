You can create and assign tasks to yourself or other members directly within a chat. Tasks help keep conversations actionable and organized, especially in 1:1 or group chats.

# Create a Task

1. Open a chat where you want to create the task.
2. Click the **+** button next to the message field.
3. Select **Assign a Task**.
4. Add a **Title** (required) and an optional **Description**.
5. Choose an **Assignee** from the chat participants, or leave it unassigned to track it yourself.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Tasks are always shared in the chat they are created in.

# Edit a Task

The task **creator** and the **assignee** can:

- **Leave comments** in the task's thread.
- **Reassign the task** by clicking the task, then clicking the arrow next to the **Assignee** field, and selecting a new person or entering their email.
- **Edit the title or description** by clicking the arrow next to each field.
- **Mark the task as complete** by checking the box or opening the task and clicking **Mark as Complete**.

âœ… **Note:** When a task is completed, it will be visibly marked as done in the chat and can be reopened if needed.
