You can customize the order of the chat messages in your inbox by pinning them to the top and/or changing your message priority to Most Recent or #focus:
- **Pin**: Bumps a specific chat up to the top of your inbox list.  
- **Message priority**: Determines the order that messages are sorted and displayed: 
   - **Most Recent**: Displays all chats by default sorted by the most recent, and keep your pinned chats at the top of the list.
   - **#focus**: Displays only unread and pinned chats sorted alphabetically.
