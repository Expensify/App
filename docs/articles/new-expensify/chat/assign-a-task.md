Tasks are a useful feature in New Expensify which allows the tracking and assignment of a task to a specific user (known as an Assignee) within a 1:1 or group chat.

# How to create a Task

1. Click on a chat
2. Click on the + button
3. Click on “Assign a Task”
4. Add a title (mandatory) and a description (optional)
5. You’ll then have the option to add an assignee to the Task. If you wish to utilise the task for tracking purposes, you can keep this unassigned.

_Note: The Task will always be shared in the chat it was created in._

# To edit a Task

Both the Task creator and the Assignee will have the option to:

- Leave a comment in the task’s thread
- Reassign the Task to someone else by clicking on the task, then the sideways arrow next to the “Assignee” field, and selecting a new Assignee or typing their email.
- Edit any of the task’s details (i.e. title and description) by clicking on the task, and then the sideways arrow next to each field.
- Mark the Task as complete by either clicking on the checkbox or clicking on the Task, then clicking on the green “Mark as Complete” button.
