Expensify Chat includes two automatically generated rooms for every workspace: **#announce** and **#admins**. These rooms help teams stay informed and allow Workspace Admins to collaborate behind the scenes.

---

# Announce Room (#announce)

The **#announce** room is available to all Workspace Members. It‚Äôs ideal for sharing company-wide updates, policy announcements, or important event reminders.

By default, **all Workspace Members can post messages** in this room. However, Workspace Admins can restrict posting permissions so that only admins can share messages.

## Restrict Messaging to Admins Only

To allow only admins to post in the #announce room:

1. Open the **#announce** room from your inbox.
2. Click the room header.
3. Click **Settings**.
4. Under **Who can post**, select **Admins only**.

üîí **Note:** Anyone in the workspace can read messages in the #announce room, but only Admins can post if this setting is enabled.

# Admins Room (#admins)

The **#admins** room is only visible to Workspace Admins. It‚Äôs designed for secure communication between admins and Expensify support contacts.

**You can use the #admins room to:**
- Coordinate with your internal admin team.
- Chat directly with your **Expensify Setup Specialist**.
- Communicate with your **Account Manager** (available with subscriptions of 10+ members).
- Track changes made to workspace settings by any admin or Expensify representative.

üîê **Note:** Only Workspace Admins can view or access this room.
