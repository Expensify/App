# Ways to Organize Your Inbox

- **Pin**: Keep important chats at the top of your inbox for quick access.
- **Priority Mode**: Choose how your chats are sorted:
  - **Most Recent** – Displays all chats sorted by the most recent activity. Pinned chats remain at the top.
  - **#focus** – Displays only unread and pinned chats, sorted alphabetically.

# Pin or Unpin a Chat

**To pin a chat:**
- Right-click the chat in your inbox and select **Pin**.
- Or, you can click into the chat, click on the member's profile image, and select **Pin**.

To unpin a chat, repeat the same action and select **Unpin**.

📌 **Note:** Pinned chats always appear at the top of your inbox.

# Change Priority Mode

To adjust how chats are sorted in your inbox:

1. In the navigation tabs (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), go to **Account > Preferences**.
2. Click or tap **Priority Mode**.
3. Select either **#focus** or **Most Recent**.

🧠 **Note:** Choose **#focus** for a distraction-free inbox with only unread and pinned chats, or stick with **Most Recent** to see everything chronologically.
