# Chat Best Practices
To get the most out of your experience at your conference and engage people in a meaningful conversation that will fulfill your goals instead of turning people off, here are some tips on what to do and not to do as an event attendee using Expensify Chat:

**Do:**
- Chat about non-business topics like where the best coffee is around the event, what great lunch options are available, or where the parties are happening that night!
- Share pictures of your travel before the event to hype everyone up, during the event if you met that person you’ve been meaning to see for years, or a fun pic from a party.
- Try to create fun groups with your fellow attendees around common interests like touring a local sight, going for a morning run, or trying a famous restaurant.

**Don't:**
- Pitch your services in public rooms like #social or speaking session rooms.
- Start a first message with a stranger with a sales pitch.
- Discuss controversial topics such as politics, religion, or anything you wouldn’t say on a first date.
- In general just remember that you are still here for business, your profile is public, and you’re representing yourself & company, so do not say anything you wouldn’t feel comfortable sharing in a business setting.

**Pro-Tips:**
Get active in Chat early and often by having real conversations around thought leadership or non-business discussions to stand out from the crowd! Also if you’re in a session and are afraid to ask a question, just ask in the chat room to make sure you can discuss it with the speaker after the session ends.

By following these tips you’ll ensure that your messages will not be [flagged for moderation](https://help.expensify.com/articles/other/Everything-About-Chat#flagging-content-as-offensive) and you will not mess it up for the rest of us.
