# Expensify Home Overview

**Home** is the starting point you see when you sign in to Expensify.

It gives you a quick way to see whether anything needs attention, get oriented, and check what’s new, without having to dig through menus or reports.

## Where to find Home

Home is the default view when you sign in.

- **Web:** Click the **Home** icon in the navigation tabs on the left to return to Home at any time.
- **Mobile:** Tap the **Home** icon in the navigation tabs on the bottom to return to Home.

## What Home shows

Home is made up of a small set of sections that summarize what’s happening in your account.

Home includes:
- **For you**
- **Discover**
- **Announcements**

Each section provides context so you know where to go next.

---

## How the For you section works on Home

The **For you** section highlights items that may need your attention like:
- “1 report to submit”
- “2 reports to approve”
- “Pay 3 reports”

Each item links you to where you can complete the action, such as a specific report or workspace.

If there’s nothing that needs action, the **For you** section may appear empty. This means you’re fully caught up.

---

## How the Discover section works on Home

The **Discover** section helps you get familiar with things you can do in Expensify.

This section includes a short demo that introduces key areas of the app and shows how different parts fit together. This can be helpful when you’re getting started or returning after some time away.

---

## How the Announcements section works on Home

The **Announcements** section shows recent Expensify product updates.

This section helps you stay informed about what’s new or recently changed in New Expensify.

# FAQ

## What is Home for?

Home helps you get oriented when you sign in. It shows whether anything needs attention, highlights what’s new, and points you to the right place—like Inbox or Reports—if you need to take action.

## Is Home the same as Inbox?

No, they serve different purposes. Home provides an overview of what needs attention and what’s new. Inbox is where conversations and action-related items are managed.

## Can actions be completed from Home?

Not directly. Home links you to other parts of Expensify where actions are completed.

## Why does the For you section sometimes appear empty?

If there are no current financial to-dos, the **For you** section may appear empty. This means there’s nothing that requires action at that time.
