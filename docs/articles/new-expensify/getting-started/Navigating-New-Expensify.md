# Left-hand bar (LHB) Navigation

The vertical **left-hand bar** is the primary navigation hub in your account. It includes:

- The **Expensify logo**, which acts as a **Home** button and takes you to your Inbox
- Top-level tabs:
  - **Inbox**
  - **Reports**
  - **Workspaces**
  - **Account**
- The **Global Create** button for quick access to actions like creating reports, expenses, invoices, and chats

# Inbox

The **Inbox** is your New Expensify homepage. It shows:

- Smart reminders to submit, approve, or reconcile expenses
- Real-time updates on recent actions, flagged reports, or incomplete tasks
- The list of chats you've started with other employees in your organization

Inbox items are dynamic and personalized based on your role and activity. Clicking an item opens the relevant screen or starts a suggested action.

# Reports Tab

The **Reports** tab consolidates all filtering and reporting tools:

- A **Workspace filter** is located inside the **Filters** menu
  - You can select a single workspace to refine the report list
  - Filters and queries update automatically to match your selections

**Note:** This Workspace filter replaces the older workspace switcher.

# Workspaces Page

The **Workspaces** tab helps you manage everything related to your company or personal workspaces. Whether you're creating a new workspace, editing an existing one, or managing features like billing and card connections, this section is your main hub.

From the **Workspaces** tab, you can:

- **Create a new workspace** – Start a new personal or company workspace using the **New workspace** button.

- **Edit categories and tags** – Create or disable expense categories and tags to organize expenses.
- **Track billing and subscription** – Navigate to the **Subscription** section to choose a plan, view billing history, or cancel your subscription.
- **Access domains** (if applicable) – Allow centralized control over company-wide settings like SAML, domain groups, and company card feeds.

**Tip:** All workspace-specific settings live under this tab, while account specific settings live under the **Account** tab.
