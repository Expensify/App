# Navigation tabs

The **navigation tabs** (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile) are primary orientation hubs in your account. They includes:

- Top-level tabs:
  - **Inbox**
  - **Reports**
  - **Workspaces**
  - **Account**
- The green **Camera/Receipt** button to easily create expenses 
- The grey **Global Create** button for additional actions like creating reports, tracking distance, sending invoices, and more.

# Inbox

The **Inbox** is your New Expensify homepage. It shows:

- Smart reminders to submit, approve, or reconcile expenses
- Real-time updates on recent actions, flagged reports, or incomplete tasks
- The list of chats you've started with other employees in your organization

Inbox items are dynamic and personalized based on your role and activity. Clicking an item opens the relevant screen or starts a suggested action.

# Reports Tab

The **Reports** tab consolidates all filtering and reporting tools:

- A **Workspace filter** is located inside the **Filters** menu
  - You can select a single workspace to refine the report list
  - Filters and queries update automatically to match your selections

**Note:** This Workspace filter replaces the older workspace switcher.
