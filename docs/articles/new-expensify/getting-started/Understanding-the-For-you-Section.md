# Understanding the For you Section

The **For you** section shows items that currently need your attention. Each item links you to the report or view where you can take action.

For you helps you see what needs attention at a glance, without having to search through Inbox or Reports.

---

## Who sees the For you section

The **For you** section appears on Home for all members.

What you see depends on:
- Your role, such as submitter, approver, or Workspace Admin
- Whether there are reports waiting on an action from you

If nothing requires your attention, the section may appear empty.

## What qualifies as a to-do in the For you section

An item appears in **For you** when a report can’t move forward without something from you.

Only actions that are required to move a report along will appear here.

---

## Which items can appear in the For you section

The **For you** section can show items like: 

- **Submit** – reports that are ready for you to submit
- **Approve** – reports waiting for your approval
- **Pay** – approved reports waiting to be paid
- **Export** – reports waiting to be exported
- **Fix** – reports that need attention before they can move forward

**ADD A SCREENSHOT HERE.**  
Suggestion: For you section showing multiple items, such as Submit, Approve, and Pay.

## How roles affect what you see in the For you section

The items you see in **For you** depend on what actions you’re responsible for.

- **Submitters** may see:
  - Submit

- **Approvers** may see:
  - Approve

- **Workspace Admins** may see:
  - Pay
  - Export
  - Fix

## Where each For you item takes you

When you select an item in **For you**, you’re taken directly to Reports, filtered to show the items that need that action.

For example:
- **Submit** takes you to reports ready to submit
- **Approve** takes you to reports waiting for approval
- **Pay** takes you to approved reports waiting to be paid
- **Export** takes you to reports waiting to be exported
- **Fix** takes you to reports that need attention

**ADD A SCREENSHOT HERE.**  
Suggestion: Selecting a For you item and landing in the filtered Reports view.

## What it means when the For you section is empty

If there are no reports waiting on you, the **For you** section may be empty. This means you’re caught up and there’s nothing you need to act on right now.

# FAQ

## Why do I see more than one item in the For you section?

If you’re responsible for more than one type of action, such as approving and paying reports, you may see multiple items at the same time.

## Why don’t I see an item even though I expect one?

An item only appears when a report is waiting specifically on you. If the report is still in progress or waiting on someone else, it won’t appear in For you.

## Does the For you section replace Inbox or Reports?

No. For you helps you spot what needs attention and takes you to the right place. All work is still completed in Reports.

## Why don’t all my reports appear in the For you section?

The For you section only shows items that currently need your attention. Completed work or items that are waiting on someone else will not show in your For you section.
