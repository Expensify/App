All Free plan customers have been automatically upgraded to our Collect plan. The Collect plan is a supercharged version of the Free plan you already know and love, but this upgrade unlocks several new features: 
- A dedicated Setup Specialist
- Expense approvals
- Invoicing and bill pay
- Custom expense categories and tags
- Multiple active expense reports at a time
- Quickbooks Online + Xero integrations (coming soon)

# Try it free + discount

**The upgrade comes at no extra cost until June 1st, 2024** to give you time to try it out for free. If you add a payment card by June 1st, you’ll qualify for a special discounted rate for your first year. The discount will be applied to your Expensify bill on a sliding scale for the first 12 months (specifics of the discount are provided in the FAQs section below).  

If you have questions, reach out to your dedicated Setup Specialist using the #admins room in your chat inbox, or email us at concierge@expensify.com.

# FAQs

**Is the upgrade optional?**

No, the upgrade is not optional. This upgrade ensures that every customer gets access to Expensify's best offerings and any new features going forward. 

**Does this mean Expensify will no longer be free for me?** 

Yes, but only if you want to continue using a workspace in Expensify. As always, you can still use Expensify for free without a workspace to track your expenses, chat with your friends, etc.

**How does the sliding-scale discount work?**

You’ll receive a discount on your Expensify bill that slowly decreases each month until you arrive at your full payment on June 1, 2025. For the first month, you’ll only pay 1/12 of the plan’s cost, and the price will gradually increase by a 12th each month. 

For example: 
- July 1: The discount covers 91.667% of your bill (11/12).
- August 1: The discount covers 83.333% of your bill (10/12).
- September 1: The discount covers 75% of your bill (9/12). 
- October 1: The discount covers 66.7% of your bill (8/12).
- November 1: The discount covers 58.3% of your bill (7/12).
- December 1: The discount covers 50% of your bill (6/12).
- January 1: The discount covers 41.667% of your bill (5/12).
- February 1: The discount covers 33.333% of your bill (4/12).
- March 1: The discount covers 25% of your bill (3/12).
- April 1: The discount covers 16.667% of your bill (2/12).
- May 1: The discount covers 8.333% of your bill (1/12).
- June 1: You pay the full bill amount from this month forward. 

The discount will be reflected on your monthly Expensify bill as a “Workspace upgrade discount.” The discount can be combined with any other offers you qualify for, including our annual subscription discount, Expensify Card discount, and Expensify Card cash back.

**How do I get in touch with my Setup Specialist?** 

You can reach your Setup Specialist by opening your workspace’s #admins room in your chat inbox and sending a message.
