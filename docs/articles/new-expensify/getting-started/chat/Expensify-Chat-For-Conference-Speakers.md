# Setting Up a Chatroom for Your Session: Checklist
To make the most of Expensify Chat for your session, here's a handy checklist:
- Confirm that your session has an Expensify Chat room, and have the URL link ready to share with attendees in advance.
  - You can find the link by clicking on the avatar for your chatroom > “Share Code” > “Copy URL to dashboard”
- Join the chat room as soon as it's ready to begin engaging with your audience right from the start.
- Consider having a session moderator with you on the day to assist with questions and discussions while you're presenting.
- Include the QR code for your session's chat room in your presentation slides. Displaying it prominently on every slide ensures that attendees can easily join the chat throughout your presentation.

# Tips to Enhance Engagement Around Your Session
By following these steps and utilizing Expensify Chat, you can elevate your session to promote valuable interactions with your audience, and leave a lasting impact beyond the conference. We can't wait to see your sessions thrive with the power of Expensify Chat!

**Before the event:**
- Share your session's QR code or URL on your social media platforms, your website or other platforms to encourage attendees to join the conversation early on.
- Encourage attendees to ask questions in the chat room before the event, enabling you to tailor your session and address their specific interests.

**During the event:**
- Keep your QR code readily available during the conference by saving it as a photo on your phone or setting it as your locked screen image. This way, you can easily share it with others you meet.
- Guide your audience back to the QR code and encourage them to ask questions, fostering interactive discussions.

**After the event:**
- Continue engaging with attendees by responding to their questions and comments, helping you expand your audience and sustain interest.
- Share your presentation slides after the event as well as any photos from your session, allowing attendees to review and share your content with their networks if they want to.
