<div id="new-expensify" markdown="1">

All customers on a Free plan have been automatically upgraded to a Collect plan!

The Collect plan is an enhanced version of the Free Plan and unlocks several new features: 
- A dedicated Setup Specialist
- Expense approvals
- Invoicing and bill pay
- Custom expense categories and tags
- Multiple active expense reports at a time
- Direct connection to Quickbooks Online
- Direct connection to Xero (coming soon!)

**The upgrade is free until June 1st!** 

To give you time to try the upgraded plan, you won't be charged for another 30 days. Additionally, if you add a payment card by June 1st, you’ll qualify for a discount over the next year. The discount will be applied to your Expensify bill on a sliding scale for the first 12 months on the Collect plan.  

If you have questions, contact your dedicated Setup Specialist using the #admins room, or email Expensify Support at concierge@expensify.com.

**Is the upgrade optional?**

No, the upgrade is not optional. This upgrade ensures that every customer gets access to Expensify's best offerings and any new features going forward. 

**Does this mean Expensify will no longer be free for me?** 

Yes, but only if you want to continue using a workspace in Expensify. As always, you can still use Expensify for free without a workspace to track your expenses, chat with your friends, etc.

**How does the sliding-scale discount work?**

You’ll receive a discount on your Expensify bill that gradually decreases each month until you reach the full payment amount on June 1, 2025. For the first month, you’ll pay 1/12 of the Collect plan’s cost, and the price will gradually increase over the course of a year. 

**Let's break that down:**
- July 1: You'll receive a ~90% discount on your monthly bill
- December 1: You'll receive a 50% discount
- March 1, 2025: You'll receive a 25% discount
- May 1, 2025: You'll receive a ~10% discount
- June 1, 2025: You pay the full bill amount for the Collect plan (starting at $5 per active member) from this date forward

The discount will be reflected on your monthly Expensify bill as a “Workspace upgrade discount” and can be combined with any other Expensify discounts—- the annual subscription discount, the Expensify Card discount, and Expensify Card cash back.

**How do I get in touch with my Setup Specialist?** 

You can reach your Setup Specialist by opening your workspace’s #admins room in your chat inbox and sending a message.
