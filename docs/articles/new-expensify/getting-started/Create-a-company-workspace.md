# 1. Create a workspace 

Workspaces help manage company expenses, enforce policies, and integrate with accounting software. Each workspace has its own set of rules, settings, company card feeds, and integrations. Once invited to a workspace, members can submit expenses according to its rules.

## Steps to Create a Workspace:
<ol type="a">
   <li>Click your profile photo or icon in the bottom left menu.</li>
   <li>Scroll down and click <b>Workspaces</b> in the left menu.</li>
   <li>Click <b>New workspace</b>.</li>
   <li>Click the Edit pencil icon next to your workspace image or icon and select <b>Upload Image</b> to choose an image from your saved files.</li>
   <li>Click <b>Name</b> to enter a new name for the workspace.</li>
   <li>Click <b>Default Currency</b> to set the currency for all expenses submitted under the workspace. Expensify automatically converts all other currencies to your default currency.</li>
</ol>
