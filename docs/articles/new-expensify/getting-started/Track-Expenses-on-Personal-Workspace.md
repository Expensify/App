# 3. Add an expense 

You can create an expense automatically by SmartScanning a receipt, or you can enter them manually. 

## SmartScan a receipt

You can upload pictures of your receipts to Expensify and SmartScan will automatically capture the receipt details including the merchant, date, total, and currency.

{% include selector.html values="desktop, mobile" %}

{% include option.html value="desktop" %}
<ol type="a">
   <li>Click the <b>Expenses</b> tab.</li>
   <li>Click the + icon in the top right and select <b>Scan Receipt</b>.</li>  
   <li>Upload a saved image of a receipt.</li>   
</ol> 
{% include end-option.html %}

{% include option.html value="mobile" %}
<ol type="a">
   <li>Open the mobile app and tap the camera icon in the bottom right corner.</li>
   <li>Upload or take a photo of your receipt.</li>  
       <ul>
           <li>Upload a photo: Click the camera icon and select the image from your device.</li>
           <li>Take a photo: Click the camera icon in the right corner to select the mode, make sure all of the transaction details are clearly visible, and then take the photo.</li>
           <ul>
              <li>Normal Mode: Upload one receipt.</li>
              <li>Rapid Fire Mode: Upload multiple receipts at once.</li>
           </ul>
       </ul>
</ol>
{% include end-option.html %}

{% include end-selector.html %}

You can open any receipt and select **Fill out details myself** to add or edit the merchant, date, total, description, category, or add attendees who took part in the expense. You can also split the expense if multiple expenses are included on one receipt.

{% include info.html %}
You can also email receipts to SmartScan by sending them to receipts@expensify.com from an email address tied to your Expensify account (either a primary or secondary email). SmartScan will automatically pull all of the details from the receipt, fill them in for you, and add the receipt to the Expenses tab on your account.

</ol>

{% include info.html %}
Categories are enabled by default. However, if you want to completely disable all categories, you can do so by clicking **More Features** in the left menu and clicking the Categories toggle to disable it.
{% include end-info.html %}

# 6. Add more features

The items that appear in your left menu under each workspace are determined by the features that are enabled for the workspace. For example, you can choose to enable or disable any of the following features: 
- Distance rates
- Workflows
- Categories
- Tags
- Taxes 

Once enabled, a new menu option with additional settings for the feature will appear in the left menu. 

To add more features,

   <li>Click <b>More features</b> in the left menu.</li>
   <li>Enable any desired feature.</li>
