- **Add manually**: Manually enter the expense details.

# Next Steps

The next steps for the expense depend on whether it was submitted to a workspace or to an individual: 
- **Expenses submitted to a workspace** are automatically added to a report and checked for any violations or inconsistencies. A chat thread for the expense is also added to your chat inbox. When you open the chat, the top banner will show the expense status and any next steps. By default, reports are automatically submitted for approval every Sunday. However, if it is ready for early submission, you can manually submit a report for approval. Once a report is submitted, your approver will be prompted to review your expense report. If changes are required, you will receive a notification to resolve any violations and resubmit. You will also be notified once your approver approves or denies your expenses. 
- **Expenses submitted to a friend** are sent right to that individual via email or text. You can chat with them about the expense in Expensify Chat, and you can receive payments through your Expensify Wallet or outside of Expensify.

{% include faq-begin.md %}
**Can I divide a payment between multiple people?**

Yes, you can split an expense to share the cost between multiple people.  

**Can I pay someone in another currency?**

While you can record your expenses in different currencies, Expensify wallets are only available for members who can add a U.S. personal bank account. 

**Can I change an expense once I’ve submitted it?**

Yes, you can edit an expense until it is paid. When an expense is submitted to a workspace, you, your approvers, and admins can edit the details on an expense except for the amount and date. 

**What are expense reports?**

In Expensify, expenses are submitted on an expense report. When a draft report is open, all new expenses are added to the draft report. Once a report is submitted, it shows what stage of the approval process the expenses are in and any required next steps.
