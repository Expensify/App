{% include selector.html values="desktop, mobile" %}

{% include option.html value="desktop" %}
1. In your chat inbox, click the expense you want to submit for approval. *Note: A green dot will appear to the right of newly created expenses.*
2. Review the next step provided at the top of the expense report.
3. If the next step is to submit the report, click **Submit**.
{% include end-option.html %}

**How do I know the status of my expense report?** 

You’ll see a Next Steps prompt at the top of your expense report to guide you through the next steps and give you a status of your report. Your workspace may have an automation set up that will automatically submit your expense reports when they are due, or you may be required to manually submit your expenses.

**Can I add more expenses to my expense report?**

Yes, you can add expenses to a report that is in a Draft or Processing status. Once a report is Approved or Reimbursed, expenses cannot be added or edited. 

**How can I get reimbursed?**

The reimbursement options depend on the workspace’s settings. 
- If the workspace is set up to send reimbursements directly to your personal bank account, you can connect a personal bank account to receive ACH payments. 
- You can receive reimbursements with your Expensify Wallet or outside of Expensify.
