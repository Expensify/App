- **How will I know if I'm the first person to refer a company to Expensify?**

Successful referrers are notified after their referral pays for two months of an annual Expensify subscription.  We'll check for the earliest recorded referrer of a member on the workspace, and if that's you, we'll let you know. 

- **How will you pay me if I am successful?**

For now, Expensify will pay successful referrers via direct deposit to the Deposit-Only bank account you have on file. Referral payouts will happen once a month. If you don't have a Deposit-Only bank account connected to Expensify at the time of your referral payout, your deposit will be processed in the next batch.

- **I’m outside of the US, how do I get paid?**

While our referral payouts are in USD, you'll be able to get paid via a Wise Borderless account. Learn more [here](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/5940/how-to-get-reimbursed-outside-the-us-with-wise-for-non-us-employees).

- **My referral wasn’t counted! How can I appeal?**

Expensify reserves the right to modify the terms of the referral program at any time, and pays out referral bonuses for eligible members at its own discretion. If you think there's been a mistake, please send a message to concierge@expensify.com with the email of your referral and our team will review your case.
