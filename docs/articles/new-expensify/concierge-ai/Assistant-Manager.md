Concierge can act as your Assistant Manager—automatically submitting, approving, reimbursing, and exporting reports on your behalf. Just send a message, and Concierge will take care of it.

# What is the Concierge Assistant Manager?

The Concierge Assistant Manager is your digital teammate for reports. It helps move reports through your workflow—whether you're submitting your own, approving others', or exporting to accounting software.

# What report actions can the Concierge Assistant Manager handle?

Concierge can assist with most common report tasks:

- Submitting your own reports  
- Approving reports submitted by your team  
- Reimbursing approved reports (if reimbursement is enabled)  
- Exporting reports to connected accounting software  
- *Coming soon:* Setting up approval workflows  

Whether you're finalizing your own expenses or clearing out team approvals, Concierge can help you get it done faster.

# What should I say to the Concierge Assistant Manager?

Use plain, natural language—no special commands needed. Here are a few examples:

- “Submit my April travel report”  
- “Approve Alice’s report for $312”  
- “Reimburse the report with the Uber and lunch expenses”  
- “Export Bob’s latest report to QuickBooks”

Concierge will confirm the action and carry it out, or ask for more detail if needed.

# How does the Concierge Assistant Manager know which report I mean?

Concierge uses context from where you're chatting to figure it out:

- **In a report chat:** It assumes you’re referring to that specific report.  
- **In a DM with Concierge:** It may ask for more details (like report name, date, or amount).  
- **In a workspace chat:** It prioritizes reports linked to that workspace.

Say what feels natural—Concierge will do its best to match your intent to the correct report.

# Can I approve or export multiple reports at once with the Assistant Manager?

Yes. Just be clear in your message. Examples:

- “Approve all pending reports from my team this week”  
- “Export all reimbursed reports from October to NetSuite”

If Concierge needs clarification, it will ask before taking action.

# What if I make a mistake?

No problem—just let Concierge know. If your role and workspace settings allow, it can often undo or adjust the action. If not, the issue will be escalated to a human for help.

# Who can use the Concierge Assistant Manager?

Anyone with the right permissions:

- **Submitting reports:** All members  
- **Approving reports:** Workspace Admins and Approvers  
- **Reimbursing and exporting:** Domain Admins or connected accounting roles  

If you try to take an action that requires a higher permission level, Concierge will let you know who can help.
