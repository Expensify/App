Need to create or update an expense? Just ask Concierge. Whether you're uploading a receipt, tracking mileage, or fixing a merchant name, the Expense Assistant can handle it — no forms required.

# What is the Expense Assistant feature?

The Expense Assistant is a built-in chatbot that helps you manage expenses by chatting with Concierge. You can create, edit, and ask questions about receipts, purchases, and mileage — all in plain language.

Instead of filling out fields manually, just say what you need, and Concierge will do the rest.

# What tasks can Concierge handle automatically?

Concierge handles many expense tasks for you behind the scenes:

- Categorizes expenses based on your Workspace rules
- Applies categories based on your past behavior
- Adds expenses to the correct report
- Moves held expenses to a new report when other expenses are submitted
- *(Coming soon)* Tags expenses based on past behavior

# How to use the Expense Assistant with Concierge

You can ask Concierge to take action on expenses directly in chat. Here’s what you can do:

## Create expenses

Say things like:

- “Create a $5 Starbucks expense for coffee with Alice”
- “Record 25 miles driving for lunch with Bob”
- “Add a $60 dinner expense to my New York trip report”

You can also:
- Upload a receipt image directly in the chat
- Email a receipt to **concierge@expensify.com**
- Text a receipt to **47777** (US only)

## Modify expenses

Ask Concierge to:
- Change the merchant
- Update the amount
- Categorize the expense
- Mark it as non-reimbursable
- Add or update tags
- Edit the description

**Example requests:**
- “Change the merchant to Extracto”
- “Change the amount to $6”
- “Categorize this as Client Meals”
- “Tag this to Bob’s Bananas”
- “Update the description to matcha with Alice”

## Add attendees or notes

Just include this info in your request:

- “Create a $15 lunch expense with Alice and Bob”
- “Add a note saying 'team celebration lunch'”
- “Add Alice as an attendee”

If something isn't supported yet, Concierge will either ask for clarification or escalate your request.

# How does Concierge know which expense to update?

Concierge uses context to figure out which expense you mean:

- **On an individual expense:** It assumes you're referring to that expense.
- **In a report chat:** It narrows the search using the merchant, amount, or description.
- **In a workspace chat:** It focuses on expenses tied to that Workspace.
- **In a direct message (DM):** It may ask for more details if it’s unclear.

The more details you provide, the easier it is for Concierge to help.

# What if I make a mistake?

No problem — just ask Concierge to fix it.

**Example:**  
> “That Starbucks expense was actually $7, not $5. Can you update it?”

Concierge will update the expense and confirm the change.

# What features are coming soon to the Expense Assistant?

We’re actively expanding what Concierge can do with expenses. Upcoming capabilities include:

- Deleting expenses via chat
- Categorizing all expenses from a specific merchant
- Attaching a receipt to a specific transaction
