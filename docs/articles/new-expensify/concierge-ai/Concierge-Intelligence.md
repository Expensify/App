Concierge isn’t just smart—it’s **context-aware**, multi-skilled, and built to help you get more done with less effort. This guide explains how Concierge works, what makes it intelligent, and how to get the most out of it.

# How Concierge works

Concierge is a **hybrid AI agent** built with GenAI, automation tools, and a powerful rules engine. It figures out what you're trying to do, pulls in the right tools, and responds with answers—or takes action automatically.

If Concierge doesn’t know something, it escalates to a real person.

# Key traits of Concierge intelligence

Concierge uses a few smart capabilities to figure out how to help:

- **Context-aware** – Understands *where* you’re asking from to tailor the response.
- **Multi-modal** – Acts like multiple assistants (support agent, expense assistant, etc.) in one.
- **Hybrid support** – Combines AI and humans, switching seamlessly when needed.
- **Natural language understanding** – Responds to conversational input like a coworker would.

# Understanding Concierge's contextual behavior

Concierge adapts based on where and how you ask questions:

- If you chat inside a **report** → It answers about that report.  
- If you're in a **DM** → It considers your full expense history.  
- If you're in a **Workspace chat** → It focuses on that Workspace.  
- If you're on a specific **expense** → It assumes you're referring to that expense.

You don’t need to explain every detail—just speak naturally and Concierge will fill in the blanks.

# What is a multi-modal agent?

Instead of having different bots for different tasks, Concierge is all-in-one. That means:

- You can ask anything—no need to figure out who to ask.  
- You can combine requests in one message.  
  - Example: “Is this reimbursable? Can you add a $12 taxi expense too?”

# Can I ask multiple things at once?

Yes! Concierge can understand complex or multi-part requests, as long as it’s clear what you want.

Here’s what works well:
- “Create a $5 lunch expense and add it to my April report.”  
- “What does ‘non-reimbursable’ mean, and can you mark this expense as such?”

The more specific you are, the better Concierge can help.

# What if Concierge doesn’t know something?

If Concierge can’t answer a question, it will escalate to a real person—often without you needing to ask.

You can also type **“Talk to a human”** at any time to request an escalation.

# What powers Concierge behind the scenes?

Concierge is powered by a mix of technology and human backup:

- A custom-trained GenAI model  
- A rules engine that handles logic and automation  
- Real-time access to your Expensify data (just enough to help)  
- Escalation paths to live support when needed

# Where to find Concierge

To chat with Concierge:

- **On web:** Click the **Concierge** button in the navigation tabs on the left.
- **On mobile:** Tap the hamburger menu in the top-left corner, then select **Concierge**.

# TL;DR – Why Concierge is different

- Understands where you’re chatting from and adjusts accordingly  
- Handles natural, multi-part questions with ease  
- Manages support, expenses, and reporting in one place  
- Escalates to a human when needed  
- No setup or training required—it just works
