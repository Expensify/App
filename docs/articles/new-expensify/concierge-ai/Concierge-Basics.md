Concierge is your built-in Expensify assistant—here to answer questions, create expenses, manage reports, and speed up your workflows. It’s part AI, part human, and always available.

# What is Concierge?

Concierge is an intelligent support agent that lives inside Expensify. It’s powered by AI and backed by real humans when needed. Whether you’re asking about a feature, creating an expense, or troubleshooting an issue, Concierge is designed to help.

Think of Concierge as your:
- Product expert  
- Expense assistant  
- Workflow manager  

All rolled into one!

# How to use Concierge AI

Just start chatting—no special commands required. Ask a question, give an instruction, or upload a receipt.

Here are a few examples you can type:
- “How do I change my Workspace settings?”  
- “Create a $12 lunch expense for today.”  
- “Submit my April travel report.”  
- “Approve Alice’s report with the Uber expense.”

**Tip:** The more specific you are, the better the response.

# What can Concierge do?

Concierge can help you:
- Answer questions about Expensify’s features and settings  
- Diagnose and troubleshoot issues  
- Create or edit expenses  
- Submit, approve, reimburse, or export reports  
- Schedule a call with a human (when available)

New features are added regularly.

# Can I ask Concierge multiple questions at once?

Yes! Just be clear in your message. Concierge can understand multi-step instructions like: 

“Is this report reimbursable? And can you create a $25 taxi expense for it?”

# Can I talk to a real person instead of Concierge?

Absolutely. Just say you’d like to chat with a human, and we’ll connect you—24/7.

If you’re working with an onboarding specialist or account manager, Concierge can schedule a call with them for you.

# FAQ

## Is Concierge a real person?

Not exactly. Concierge is an AI-powered assistant that helps with support, expenses, and approvals. But if it can’t help—or if you prefer a human—it’ll bring in a real person automatically.

## Do I have to use special commands to talk to Concierge?

Nope! Just type naturally, like you’re messaging a coworker. You can ask questions, give instructions, or even send receipts directly in the chat.

## What happens if Concierge doesn’t understand my question?

If something’s unclear, Concierge will ask for more details. And if it still can’t help, it’ll escalate to a human who can jump in.

## Can I use Concierge on both web and mobile?

Yes! Concierge is available everywhere—desktop, mobile app, email, and even SMS. Wherever you start a chat, Concierge will follow the conversation across platforms.

## Is it safe to send receipts or sensitive info to Concierge?

Yes. Concierge only sees what it needs to help with your request. Expensify doesn’t use your data to train public AI models, and we have zero-retention agreements with our partners.

## What if I change my mind and want to talk to a human?

Just say so! You can type “Talk to a human” at any time and you’ll be connected with a real support rep.
