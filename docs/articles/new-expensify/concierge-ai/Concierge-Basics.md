# What is Concierge AI in New Expensify?

Concierge is an intelligent support agent that lives inside Expensify. It’s powered by AI and backed by real humans when needed. Whether you’re asking about a feature, creating an expense, or troubleshooting an issue, Concierge is designed to help.

Think of Concierge as your:
- Product expert  
- Expense assistant  
- Workflow manager  

All rolled into one!

# How to use Concierge AI

Just start chatting—no special commands required. Ask a question, give an instruction, or upload a receipt.

Here are a few examples you can type:
- “How do I change my Workspace settings?”  
- “Create a $12 lunch expense for today.”  
- “Submit my April travel report.”  
- “Approve Alice’s report with the Uber expense.”

> **Tip:** The more specific you are, the better the response.

# What makes Concierge AI different?

Concierge isn’t just a chatbot. It’s a **hybrid agent** that adapts to your needs and understands context.

- **Contextual:** Ask the same question in different places (DM, report chat, workspace chat) and get tailored answers.  
- **Hybrid:** Concierge uses AI for most questions and seamlessly escalates to a human if needed.  
- **Multi-modal:** No need to choose between support, expense, or approval bots—Concierge handles them all.

# What can Concierge AI do?

Concierge can help you:
- Answer questions about Expensify’s features and settings  
- Diagnose and troubleshoot issues  
- Create or edit expenses  
- Submit, approve, reimburse, or export reports  
- Schedule a call with a human (when available)

New features are added regularly.

# Can I ask Concierge AI multiple questions at once?

Yes! Just be clear in your message. Concierge can understand multi-step instructions like:

> “Is this report reimbursable? And can you create a $25 taxi expense for it?”

# Can I talk to a real person instead of Concierge AI?

Absolutely. Just say you’d like to chat with a human, and we’ll connect you—24/7.

If you’re working with an onboarding specialist or account manager, Concierge can schedule a call with them for you.

# How does Concierge AI protect my data?

Concierge is built with privacy at its core:
- Your data stays inside Expensify and is only accessed as needed.  
- AI systems never see more than what's required to respond to your message.  
- We have **zero-retention** agreements with AI providers, meaning your data is never stored or reused.

There’s no risk of another customer seeing your data—because they can’t.

# How to disable human escalation in Concierge AI

Prefer an AI-only experience? You can prevent Concierge from escalating your messages to a human.

**To disable escalation:**
1. Go to `Account > Settings > Preferences`.  
2. Toggle off **Allow Concierge to escalate to humans**.
