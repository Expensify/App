Concierge is your built-in Expensify assistant—here to answer questions, create expenses, manage reports, and get things done faster. It's part AI, part human, and always available.

# What is Concierge AI?

Concierge is an intelligent support agent that lives inside Expensify. It’s powered by AI but backed by real people when needed. Whether you’re asking about a feature, creating an expense, or chasing down a report, Concierge is built to help.

Think of it as your:
- Product expert   
- Expense assistant 
- Workflow manager 

All rolled into ond!  

# Where to find Concierge AI

You can chat with Concierge from anywhere in Expensify.

- **On web:** Click the chat icon in the lower-right corner of any page.  
- **On mobile:** Tap the hamburger menu in the top-left, then choose **Concierge**.

You can also:
- Email: **concierge@expensify.com**  
- Text: **47777** (US only)

# How to talk to Concierge

Just start chatting - literally. You don’t need special commands. Ask questions, give instructions, or upload a receipt. A few examples:

- “How do I change my Workspace settings?”  
- “Create a $12 lunch expense for today.”  
- “Submit my April travel report.”  
- “Approve Alice’s report with the Uber expense.”

The more specific you are, the better the response.

# What makes Concierge different?

Concierge isn’t just a chatbot. It’s a **hybrid agent** designed to adapt to your needs and your context.

- **Contextual** – Ask the same question in different places (DM, report chat, workspace chat) and get a context-specific answer.  
- **Hybrid** – Concierge uses AI for most things, but passes the chat to a real person if needed.  
- **Multi-modal** – No need to choose between support, expense, or approval bots—Concierge handles it all.

# Can I ask multiple questions at once?

Yes! Just be clear. Concierge can handle multi-step or multi-question messages like:

> “Is this report reimbursable? And can you create a $25 taxi expense for it?”

# Can I talk to a real person?

Yep. Just say you’d like to chat with a human, and we’ll connect you 24/7.

If you’re working with an onboarding specialist or account manager, Concierge can even schedule a call for you.

# What can Concierge do?

Here’s what it can help with today:
- Answer questions about Expensify’s features and settings  
- Diagnose and troubleshoot issues  
- Create or edit expenses  
- Submit, approve, reimburse, or export reports  
- Schedule calls with real humans (when available)

And there’s more on the way.

# How does Concierge keep my data safe?

We built Concierge with privacy at the core:
- Your data stays within Expensify—Concierge only sees what it needs to help you.  
- LLMs never access more than the info required for your unique message.  
- We have **zero-retention** agreements with AI partners, so your data isn’t stored or reused.

There’s no risk of another customer “seeing” your data—because they can’t.

# Want to go AI-only?

If you’d prefer not to include human support, you can disable escalation entirely.

**To do this:**  
Go to `Account > Preferences > Allow Concierge to escalate to humans` and toggle it off.
