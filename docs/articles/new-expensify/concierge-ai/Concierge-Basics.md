# FAQ

## Is Concierge a real person?

Not exactly. Concierge is an AI-powered assistant that helps with support, expenses, and approvals. But if it can’t help—or if you prefer a human—it’ll bring in a real person automatically.

## Do I have to use special commands to talk to Concierge?

Nope! Just type naturally, like you’re messaging a coworker. You can ask questions, give instructions, or even send receipts directly in the chat.

## What happens if Concierge doesn’t understand my question?

If something’s unclear, Concierge will ask for more details. And if it still can’t help, it’ll escalate to a human who can jump in.

## Can I use Concierge on both web and mobile?

Yes! Concierge is available everywhere—desktop, mobile app, email, and even SMS. Wherever you start a chat, Concierge will follow the conversation across platforms.

## Is it safe to send receipts or sensitive info to Concierge?

Yes. Concierge only sees what it needs to help with your request. Expensify doesn’t use your data to train public AI models, and we have zero-retention agreements with our partners.

## What if I change my mind and want to talk to a human?

Just say so! You can type “Talk to a human” at any time and you’ll be connected with a real support rep.

## Can I turn off human support completely?

Yes. If you’d rather stick with AI-only replies, you can disable human escalation from your preferences. You can do this via `Account > Settings > Preferences` and toggle off **Allow Concierge to escalate to humans**.
