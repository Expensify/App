<div id="new-expensify" markdown="1">

When you reimburse a report, you authorize Expensify to withdraw the funds from your account. If your bank rejects Expensifyâ€™s withdrawal request, your verified bank account is locked until the issue is resolved.

Withdrawal requests can be rejected due to insufficient funds, or if the bank account has not been enabled for direct debit.

## To request to unlock a bank account:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > _Workspace Name_ > Bank account** and click **Fix**
2. This sends a request to our support team to review why the bank account was locked, who will send you a message outlining some next steps

Unlocking a bank account can take several business days to process due to ACH processing times and clawback periods.

**If you need to enable direct debits from your verified bank account, your bank will require the following details:**
- The ACH CompanyIDs (1270239450, 4270239450 and 2270239450) 
- The ACH Originator Name (Expensify)

**If using Expensify to process Bill payments, you'll also need to whitelist the ACH IDs from our partner [Stripe](https://support.stripe.com/questions/ach-direct-debit-company-ids-for-stripe?):**
- The ACH CompanyIDs (1800948598 and 4270465600)
- The ACH Originator Name (expensify.com)

**If using Expensify to process international reimbursements from your USD bank account, you'll need to whitelist the ACH IDs from our payment partner CorPay:**
- The ACH CompanyIDs (1522304924 and 2522304924)
- The ACH Originator Name (Cambridge Global Payments)
