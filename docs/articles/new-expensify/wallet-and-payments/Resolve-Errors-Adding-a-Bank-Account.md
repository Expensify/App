Expensify is required to verify the identity of the individual who is connecting a business bank account.

**If you get a generic error message while uploading your ID, please go through the following steps:**
1. Ensure you are using either Safari (on iPhone) or Chrome (on Android) as your web browser.
2. Check your browser's permissions to make sure that the camera and microphone settings are set to "Allow"
3. Clear your web cache for Safari (on iPhone) or Chrome (on Android).
4. If using a corporate Wi-Fi network, confirm that your corporate firewall isn't blocking the website.
5. Make sure no other apps are overlapping your screen, such as the Facebook Messenger bubble, while recording the video. 
6. On iPhone, if using iOS version 15 or later, disable the Hide IP address feature in Safari.
7. If possible, try these steps on another device
8. If you have another phone available, try to follow these steps on that device
