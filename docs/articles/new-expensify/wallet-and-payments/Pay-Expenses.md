# FAQ

## Once I pay an expense, how long does it take for the deposit to reach the submitter’s bank account?

- If the payment is coming from a **personal bank account** and is under $100, it will process in one business day. 
- If the payment is coming from a **business bank account** and the total withdrawal amount has not exceeded $10,000 in the last 24 hours, the payment will process in one business day. 

Otherwise, the payment will follow the standard bank transfer timeframe, and the recipient can expect to receive their payment within 4-5 business days. 

## Can I pay someone in another currency?

You can record expenses in different currencies, but all payments are made to U.S.-based personal or business bank accounts.
