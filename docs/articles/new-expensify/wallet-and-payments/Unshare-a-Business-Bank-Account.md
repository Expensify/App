# Unshare a business bank account

If other Workspace Admins have access to your business bank account in Expensify, you can unshare it at any time to revoke their access. Unsharing access is especially helpful when someone changes roles or leaves the company.

Unsharing the account removes it from the other admin's Wallet immediately and prevents that admin from using it to reimburse reports, pay bills, or use it with the Expensify Card. We'll still complete any payments in process that the admin issued.

## Unsharing when the account is set as Expensify Card settlement account

If the admin's copy of the bank account is currently set as the **Expensify Card settlement account**, you'll see an error message and won't be able to unshare from that admin.

To resolve this:
- Click **Reach out to Concierge** in the error message to get help switching the settlement account.

Yes. They’ll receive a message from Concierge letting them know they no longer have access to the bank account.

The business bank account is removed from the admin's Wallet. The admin can no longer use the account for any payments or reimbursement features. We'll still complete any payments in process that the admin issued beforehand.
