# What is Global Reimbursement?

Global reimbursement allows companies to send payments to employees in different countries using Expensify. Once your business bank account is verified and connected, employees can add their deposit-only accounts to receive payments directly.

# FAQ

## Can other admins send global reimbursements?
Yes. Once verified, the reimbursement account can be shared with other workspace admins.

## How long does it take to verify an account for global reimbursement?
The verification process can take anywhere from a few business days to several weeks, depending on whether all required documentation is provided when it begins.

## Why is my employee not receiving the full deposit?
Some employees paid into a bank account for a different currency may see a slightly smaller reimbursement amount than expected due to the FX incurred when transmitting the payment across borders or even by fees charged by their receiving bank. Currently, this difference is always seen by the employee receiving funds, and the company will always see the report amount 1:1 on their statement.  

## Why is the reimbursement amount different from the expense amount?
If your workspace and employees use different currencies, the reimbursement amount might vary due to double conversion.  
For example, if a CAD expense is submitted in a USD workspace, the expense is converted from CAD → USD by Expensify. If the USD amount is paid back to the employee into a CAD account, the amount is converted again from USD to CAD, using exchange rates set by two different providers, typically on two different days.
Exchange rate differences and transaction fees can cause the final amount to differ slightly from the original expense amount.

If a payment bounces and must be returned to the business bank account, the conversion fee is incurred again on the way back, resulting in returned payments being credited to the business bank account for a different amount than was originally withdrawn. You can stay on top of reconciling these with the "International Reimbursement ID" numbers stored in the details of each report.
