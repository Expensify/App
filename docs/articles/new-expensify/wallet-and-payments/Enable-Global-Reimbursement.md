# What is Global Reimbursement?

Global reimbursement allows companies to send payments to employees in different countries using Expensify. Once your business bank account is verified and connected, employees can add their deposit-only accounts to receive payments directly.

**Note:** Each country has specific identity verification, compliance, and onboarding requirements. Use the guides above to ensure you're submitting the correct documentation.

# FAQ

## Can other admins send global reimbursements?
Yes. Once verified, the reimbursement account can be shared with other workspace admins.

## How long does it take to verify an account for global reimbursement?
The verification process can take anywhere from a few business days to several weeks, depending on whether all required documentation is provided when it begins.

## Why is my employee not receiving the full deposit?
Some employees may receive a slightly smaller reimbursement than expected when paid into a bank account with a different currency. This happens due to foreign exchange (FX) fees when transmitting payments across borders, or fees charged by the receiving bank. The employee absorbs these fees, while the company sees the full report amount on their statement.

## Why is the reimbursement amount different from the expense amount?
If your workspace and employees use different currencies, the reimbursement amount received by the employee will differ from the original expense amount. Exchange rates set by different providers on different days can cause the final amount to differ slightly from the original expense. Transaction fees may also contribute to this difference.

If a payment bounces and must be returned to the business bank account, the conversion fee is incurred again. This means the returned payment will be credited to your business bank account for an amount different from the original withdrawal. Track and reconcile these differences using the 'International Reimbursement ID' stored in each report's details.
