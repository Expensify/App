# Sharing a business bank account in Expensify

If you’ve already added a business bank account, you can share access to that account with other Workspace Admins. This eliminates the need to repeat the full setup process.

## Who can share a business bank account in Expensify

Only **Workspace Admins** can share an existing business bank account. You can only share accounts that have been verified. 

## Where to find the business bank account sharing option

Go to the navigation tabs and select **Settings > Wallet**. 

## How to share a business bank account

To share an existing account with other admins:

1. Open **Settings > Wallet**.
2. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the bank account you want to share.
3. Select **Share**.
4. On the Share screen:
   - The list shows only Workspace Admins from workspaces where you also have admin access.
5. Select the admins you want to share with, then click **Share**.
6. You’ll see a confirmation screen once the share is successful.

**Note:** You’ll only see Admins of workspaces where you’re also an admin in the list.

## What happens after sharing a business bank account

- The shared-to admins will receive a Concierge message letting them know the account was shared.
- They’ll now see the account in their **Wallet**.

**For US accounts:**
- The shared account appears with an **Action required** badge.
- The shared-to admin will need to **validate** the account by entering test transactions.
- After validation, they can begin using it. 

**For non-US accounts:**
- The shared account is ready to use immediately — no test transactions required.

## How business bank account sharing works when changing the payer

When changing the **Authorized Payer** in a Workspace:

- If you have access but the new payer doesn't:
  - You'll be prompted to share the bank account from the Authorized Payer screen.
  - The account shares immediately when you confirm.
  - A confirmation screen appears after successful sharing.

- If your own copy of the bank account is pending validation, and you try to assign a new payer who doesn’t have access:
  - You’ll see an error prompting you to **validate your account first** by entering the test transactions before changing payers.

- If **neither** you nor the new selected payer has access:
  - You’ll be shown an error telling you to ask the current payer to share the account.

This process ensures you can only set an Authorized Payer who already has bank account access or receives access during the payer change.

# FAQ

## Why share a business bank account?

Sharing saves time. You don’t have to redo the full verification process, and it makes it easier to:
- Change the workspace payer
- Set up new Workspaces
- Enable reimbursements without delay

## Can I share the same bank account with multiple admins?

Yes. You can share a bank account with multiple admins at once. 

## Why don’t I see the Share option?

You’ll only see **Share** if the bank account is verified and there is at least one eligible Workspace Admin you haven’t shared with yet.

## What if the other admin already has a copy of the account?

If an admin already has access to the bank account, they won’t appear in the share list.

## Can a shared admin share the bank account with others?

Yes — once an admin has validated the account (if required), they can share the bank account with other admins. 

## Can I share a bank account during the payer change process?

Yes. If the new payer doesn’t already have access, you’ll be prompted to share the bank account before confirming the payer change. This ensures the new payer can reimburse expenses without delay.

## What happens if I try to set a payer but neither of us has bank account access?

You’ll be shown an error and prompted to ask the current payer to share the account with one of you before proceeding.
