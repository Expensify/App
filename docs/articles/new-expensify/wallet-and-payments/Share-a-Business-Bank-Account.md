# Sharing a business bank account in Expensify

If you’ve already added a business bank account, you can share access to that account with other Workspace Admins. This eliminates the need to repeat the full setup process.

## Who can share a business bank account in Expensify

Only **Workspace Admins** can share an existing business bank account. You can only share accounts that have been verified. 

## Where to find the business bank account sharing option

Go to the navigation tabs and select **Settings > Wallet**. 

## How to share a business bank account

To share an existing account with other admins:

1. Open **Settings > Wallet**.
2. Click the **three-dot menu (⋮)** next to the bank account you want to share.
3. Select **Share**.
4. On the Share screen:
   - The list shows only Workspace Admins from workspaces where you also have admin access.
5. Select the admins you want to share with, then click **Share**.
6. You’ll see a confirmation screen once the share is successful.

**Note:** You’ll only see Admins of workspaces where you’re also an admin in the list.

## What happens after sharing a business bank account

- The shared-to admins will receive a Concierge message letting them know the account was shared.
- They’ll now see the account in their **Wallet**.

**For US accounts:**
- The shared account appears with an **Action required** badge.
- The shared-to admin will need to **validate** the account by entering test transactions.
- After validation, they can begin using it. 

**For non-US accounts:**
- The shared account is ready to use immediately — no test transactions required.

# FAQ

## Why share a business bank account?

Sharing saves time. You don’t have to redo the full verification process, and it makes it easier to:
- Change the workspace payer
- Set up new Workspaces
- Enable reimbursements without delay

## Can I share the same bank account with multiple admins?

Yes. You can share a bank account with multiple admins at once. 

## Why don’t I see the Share option?

You’ll only see **Share** if the bank account is verified and there is at least one eligible Workspace Admin you haven’t shared with yet.

## What if the other admin already has a copy of the account?

If an admin already has access to the bank account, they won’t appear in the share list.

## Can a shared admin share the bank account with others?

Yes — once an admin has validated the account (if required), they can share the bank account with other admins.
