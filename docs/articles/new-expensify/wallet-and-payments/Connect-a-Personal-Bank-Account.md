## Is there a fee to add a personal account?

No. Expensify does not charge you to add or use a personal account. It’s included in your Expensify subscription. 

## Are there countries where personal bank accounts aren’t supported?

## Why can't I add my HSBC bank account details in Singapore?

You can. HSBC typically includes the **branch code** which is the final three digits of the Swift Code (HSBCSGS2XXX) in their "Account Number". If you see figures like "146172002492", please drop first 3 digit (146) which is the Branch Code.
