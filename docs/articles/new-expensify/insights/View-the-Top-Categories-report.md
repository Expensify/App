# FAQ

## Can I export the Top Categories report?

To export expenses:

1. Go to the **Reports** or **Expenses** tab.
2. Use filters to group by category and apply the same timeframe.
3. Expand the category group, select the expenses, and click **Export to CSV**.

## What’s the difference between the Top Categories report and the Top Spenders report?

The **Top Categories** report shows the highest-spending **expense categories**, while the **Top Spenders** report shows which **employees** submitted the most expenses. Both reports help identify trends, but from different perspectives:

- Use **Top Categories** to track spending by type (e.g., Travel, Meals).
- Use **Top Spenders** to track who is submitting the most expenses.

## How is the Top Categories report calculated?

The report uses all expenses from the previous calendar month and groups them by category. It shows the **top 10 categories** based on total spend.
