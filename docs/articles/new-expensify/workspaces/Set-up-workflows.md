Workflows allow you to enable or disable expense approval settings. If you are tracking your personal expenses, you probably don’t need someone to approve those expenses. But if you are tracking employee expenses, you might want extra approval settings for those expenses. 

{% include info.html %}
Workflows are available for Collect and Control workspaces. Additionally, you must be a Workspace Admin to complete this process.

You can choose to require additional approvals and/or allow delayed submissions.

1. Click **Workflows** in the left menu.
2. Enable the toggle for the desired workflow setting: 

- **Add Approvals**: Requires additional approval for an expense before a payment can be authorized. Once enabled, click the Approver field to select an approver. This person must be a workspace admin. The default approver is the workspace owner.
- **Delay Submissions**: Determines when issue-free expenses are automatically submitted. Once enabled, choose a delay frequency: 
-- With delayed submission **enabled**, all reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses will be submitted at a designated frequency.
-- If delay submission is **disabled**, all reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses are submitted instantly.

**If I have delayed submission and an approver, what should I expect with a report?**

When Add Approver is enabled with Delay Submission, expense reports go from Open > Processing > Approved. If delayed submission is disabled, expense reports go from Processing > Approved.
