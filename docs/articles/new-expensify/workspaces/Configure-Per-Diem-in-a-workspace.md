# Upload or Export Per Diem Rates

Admins can manage rates by uploading a spreadsheet or exporting existing ones.

- **Import spreadsheet** – Upload a CSV to add or update rates.
- **Download CSV** – Export your current Per Diem rate list.

Both options are found in the **three-dot menu** at the top-right corner of the Per Diem page.
