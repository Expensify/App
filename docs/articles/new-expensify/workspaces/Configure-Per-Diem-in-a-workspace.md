# FAQ

## Why donâ€™t I see the Per Diem option when submitting an expense?
The Per Diem option is only available if you are a member of a workspace with Per Diem enabled. If you are submitting an expense outside a workspace (such as in a group chat or DM), the option will not appear.

## Can I bulk-edit or delete Per Diem rates?
Yes, you can select multiple rates at once and apply bulk actions such as editing or deleting.
