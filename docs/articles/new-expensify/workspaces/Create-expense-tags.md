In Expensify, **tags** represent attributes like classes, projects, cost centers, locations, customers, or jobs. They help code expenses for accounting and reporting.

Admins can manually create tags for a workspace, or they can be imported automatically if your workspace is connected to an accounting system like QuickBooks Online, Intacct, Xero, or NetSuite. Once added, tags can be enabled or disabled. Over time, Expensify also learns how you use tags for certain merchants and applies them automatically.

# Apply Tags to Expenses Automatically

- Manual corrections are remembered over time.
- Existing tags on an expense will not be overwritten automatically.
- Workspace-level **Expense Rules** take priority over automated tag suggestions.

# FAQ

## Can I Edit Tags on a Submitted Expense Report?

Yes. You can edit tags until the expense is approved or reimbursed.

Approvers can also edit tags, even post-approval, by taking control of the report.

## Can I See an Audit Trail of Tag Changes?

Yes. When a tag is manually changed, the update is logged in the associated expense chat.

## What Happens if a Tag Is Disabled in My Accounting System?

It will be removed from the workspaceâ€™s tag list. However, it will still appear on any expenses or reports where it was already applied.

## Can I Set Up Multi-Level Tags in New Expensify?

Not yet. New Expensify currently supports only **single-level tags**. If your account used multi-level tags in Expensify Classic, only the first level will appear. Support for multi-level tags is in development.
