# Add approvals 

Each Expensify workspace can be configured to require additional approvals before payments are authorized. Once approvals are enabled on a workspace, admins will be able to set a default approval workflow to apply to all members of the workspace, as well as set custom approval workflows for specific members. 

When workspace members submit expenses, the expenses will require approval from each approver in their approval workflow before payment is authorized.
