4. Click **Tags** or **Categories**.

Once enabled, the **Tag** or **Category** field will be marked as **required** on all expenses.

> **Note:** If Tags or Categories are required, expenses can still be submitted without them. However, the submitter and approver will see an orange dot on the expense, indicating that the required Tag or Category is missing.

2. Click **Workspaces**.
3. Select a Workspace.
4. Click **Categories**.
5. Click **Settings** at the top right.
