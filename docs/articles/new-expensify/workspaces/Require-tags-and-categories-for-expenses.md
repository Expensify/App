# Require Tags or Categories for Expenses

When this setting is turned on, expenses must include a **tag** or **category** before submission. The relevant field will display as **required** during entry.

**Note:** If tags or categories are required but not applied, the expense can still be submitted. However, the submitter and approver will see an orange dot indicating the field needs attention.

5. Toggle on **Members must tag or categorize all expenses**.
