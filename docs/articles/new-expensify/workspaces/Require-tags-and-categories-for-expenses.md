To require workspace members to add tags and/or categories to their expenses, 

{% include selector.html values="desktop, mobile" %}

{% include option.html value="desktop" %}
1. Click your profile image or icon in the bottom left menu.
2. Scroll down and click **Workspaces** in the left menu. 
3. Select a workspace. 
4. Click **Tags** or **Categories** in the left menu.
5. Click **Settings** at the top right of the page. 
6. Enable the “Members must tag/categorize all expenses" toggle. 
7. If desired, repeat steps 4-6 for tags or categories (whichever you haven’t done yet).
{% include end-option.html %}

{% include option.html value="mobile" %}
1. Tap your profile image or icon in the bottom menu.
2. Tap **Workspaces**. 
3. Select a workspace. 
4. Tap **Tags** or **Categories**.
5. Tap **Settings** at the top right of the page. 
6. Enable the “Members must tag/categorize all expenses" toggle. 
7. If desired, repeat steps 4-6 for tags or categories (whichever you haven’t done yet).
{% include end-option.html %}

{% include end-selector.html %}

![In the Workspace > Categories setting, the right-hand panel is open and the toggle to require categories on expenses is highlighted.]({{site.url}}/assets/images/workspace_category_toggle.png){:width="100%"}
   
This will highlight the tag and/or category field as required on all expenses. 

{% include info.html %}
Expenses will still be able to be submitted without a tag and/or category even if they are set as required. The submitter and approver will see an orange dot on the expense details alerting them that the tag/category is missing.
{% include end-info.html %}
