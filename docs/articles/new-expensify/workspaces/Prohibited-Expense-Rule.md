Enable the Prohibited Expenses rule to help Workspace Admins enforce compliance by automatically flagging receipts that contain restricted purchases like alcohol, gambling, or tobacco. This rule uses Expensify’s AI-powered SmartScan to review individual line items and alert admins when prohibited categories are detected.

Once set up, SmartScan reviews scanned receipts at the line-item level:

- Works in both **New Expensify** and **Expensify Classic**
- Can only be configured in **New Expensify**
- Automatically adds a violation to a prohibited expense type
