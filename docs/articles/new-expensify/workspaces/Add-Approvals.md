Each Expensify workspace can be configured to require additional approvals before payments are authorized. When approvals are enabled, admins can set a default approval workflow for all members or create custom workflows for individual members.

Once a member submits an expense, it must be approved by each person in their workflow before it can be paid.

# Configure Approval Workflows

Set up default or custom approval workflows to route expenses through one or more approvers before they're paid. Default approval workflows are available on both Collect and Control plans, but custom workflows for specific members require the Control plan.

2. Click your workspace name to access the settings for that workspace.
3. In the left menu, click **Workflows**.
4. Under **Expenses from Everyone**, click **First approver**.
5. Choose the first approver from the list of workspace members.
6. Under **Additional approver**, continue adding members as needed.
7. Click **Save**.

**Note:** When approvals are enabled, a default workflow is required for the workspace.

### Set a Custom Workflow for Specific Members

1. Navigate to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Workflows**.
2. Under **Add approvals**, click **Add approval workflow**.
3. Choose the member whose expenses should have a custom workflow.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Select the first approver for their expenses.
6. Click **Next**.
7. Use **Additional approver** to add more approvers.

# FAQ

## Can an employee have more than one approval workflow applied to them?

No. Each employee can only be assigned one approval workflow per workspace.

## How can I assign custom approval workflows to specific members?

You’ll need to be on the Control plan, as this feature isn’t available on Collect.
