Report Fields let workspace admins collect additional header-level information on reports, such as project names, client codes, or trip types. This feature is only available on the **Control plan**.

**Note:** If your workspace is connected to an accounting system like QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, Intacct, Xero, or NetSuite, Report Fields must be created in that system directly. [Learn more about connecting integrations.](#)
