Report fields are only available on the Control plan. You cannot create these report fields directly in Expensify if you are connected to an accounting integration (QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, Intacct, Xero, or NetSuite). Please refer to the relevant article for instructions on creating fields within that system.
