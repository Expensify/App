If you have a private domain (e.g., yourcompany.com), you can verify it in Expensify to manage employee permissions and enable additional security features.

# Verify Your Domain



1. Log in to your DNS service provider (e.g., Namecheap, GoDaddy, Amazon Route 53). If your domain is managed internally, contact your IT department.
2. Locate the DNS Records page (sometimes labeled as DNS Management or Zone File Editor).
3. Add a TXT record with the verification value provided in Expensify under **Workspaces > Domains > three-dot menu > Verify domain**.
4. Save your changes.

Once verified, you’ll see a confirmation message and your domain will be marked as **Verified**.
