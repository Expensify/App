Managing members in a workspace helps ensure that the right people can submit, approve, and review expenses. This guide walks through how to invite, remove, and update roles for members in New Expensify.

A **Workspace member** is anyone added to a workspace with one of the following roles:

- **Member** – Can submit and/or approve expenses.
- **Admin** – Can manage members, roles, workflows, and settings.
- **Auditor** – Can view and comment on reports but cannot make changes.
