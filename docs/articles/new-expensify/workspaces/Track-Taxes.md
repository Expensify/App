Workspaces on the **Collect** and **Control** plans can add tax rates to track VAT, GST, or other regional taxes. Tax rates are applied by default based on currency, but can also be manually selected per expense.

**Note:** Taxes can only be managed manually in workspaces that do **not** use a direct accounting integration (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite). If you’re connected to an integration, tax rates must be managed within that system.
