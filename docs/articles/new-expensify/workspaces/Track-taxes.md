# Track taxes

Each Expensify workspace can be configured with one or more tax rates. Once tax rates are enabled on your workspace, all expenses will have a default tax rate applied based on the currency, and employees will be able to select the correct tax rate for each expense.

Tax rates are only available on the Control plan. Collect plan users will need to upgrade to Control for access to tag tax codes.

## Enable taxes on a workspace

Tax codes are only available on the Control plan. Taxes can be enabled on any workspace where the default currency is not USD. Please note that if you have a direct accounting integration, tax rates will be managed through the integration and cannot be manually enabled or disabled using the instructions below.

**To enable taxes on your workspace:**

1. Click your profile image or icon in the bottom left menu
2. Click **Workspaces** in the left menu
3. Select the workspace where you want to enable tax codes
4. Click **More features** in the left menu
5. Click the toggle next to **Taxes**

After toggling on taxes, you will see a new **Taxes** option in the left menu.

## Manually add, delete, or edit tax rates

**To manually add a tax rate:**

1. Click your profile image or icon in the bottom left menu

## Change the default tax rates

After enabling taxes in your workspace, you can set two default rates:

- **Workspace currency default:** Any expenses created in the workspace default currency will default to this tax rate. Employees can select a different tax rate if applicable.
- **Foreign currency default:** Expenses created in any currency besides the workspace default currency will default to this tax rate. Employees can select a different tax rate if applicable.

**To change the default tax rates:**

1. On the **Taxes** settings page, click **Settings** in the top right
2. Click **Workspace currency default** or **Foreign currency default** and select the desired tax rate
