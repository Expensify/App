Workspace Rules let Admins enforce expense policies by setting custom requirements for receipts, spending limits, category behavior, auto-approvals, and more. These rules help ensure compliance and streamline the approval process.

**Note:** Rules are only available on the **Control** plan. You must be a **Workspace Admin** to enable or manage them.

# What happens if Expense Rules are broken 

When an expense breaks a Workspace Rule or Category Rule, the expense is flagged with a violation and the approver is prompted to manually review it before approval.

# How to configure the Prohibited Expenses Rule

Use this AI-powered rule to flag receipts with restricted purchases.

To enable it:

1. Go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Rules > Expenses**.
2. Scroll to the **Prohibited Expenses** section.
3. Toggle it on and select any categories to monitor:
   - Alcohol
   - Gambling
   - Tobacco
   - Hotel Incidentals
   - Adult Entertainment

**Note:** Violations appear in both New Expensify and Expensify Classic, but the rule must be enabled in **New Expensify**.

# FAQ

## Who can manage workspace rules?

Only Workspace Admins on the **Control** plan can enable, update, or disable workspace rules.

## What happens if I turn workspace rules off?

Disabling workspace rules removes any active warnings or violations from draft or outstanding expenses that relied on those rules.

## Can I disable SmartScan for my workspace?

No, SmartScan can’t be disabled for group (paid) workspaces and cannot be turned off.

## When does the “Company card purchases required” violation appear?

This violation is triggered when an expense meets **any** of the following conditions:

- It’s created as cash and is older than seven days  
- It’s imported from a personal card feed  
- It’s manually changed from a card expense to a cash expense

## Why don’t I see the toggle for the company card rule?

The **Require Company Card for All Purchases** rule only appears after at least one company card feed is connected to the workspace. If all company card feeds are removed, the rule will automatically disable. 

## What happens if I disable eReceipts?

Disabling eReceipts hides any previously generated eReceipts. Re-enabling the feature will restore those receipts.

## Will disabling rules affect submitted or approved expenses?

No. Disabling a rule only affects expenses that are in draft or awaiting submission. Submitted or approved expenses remain unchanged.

## What happens if a Category or Tag Rule conflicts with a Workspace Rule?

Category and Tag Rules take priority over Workspace Rules. When both apply to the same expense, the category-specific setting is used.
