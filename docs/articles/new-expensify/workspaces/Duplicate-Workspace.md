# How to Duplicate a Workspace

Duplicating a workspace allows you to quickly create a new workspace using the structure and settings of an existing one.

## Steps to Duplicate a Workspace:

1. Navigate to **Workspaces > More > Duplicate**
2. Name Your New Workspace: When prompted, enter a name for your new workspace.
3. Choose the data and settings you want to carry over to the new workspace. You can customize which elements are duplicated, including:
- Overview
- Members
- Reports
- Accounting Connection
- Categories
- Tags
- Taxes
- Workflows
- Rules
- Distance Rates
- Per Diem
- Invoices

**Note:** If you’ve chosen to copy Members from a current workspace to the new duplicated workspace, you’ll be asked to **Review and Confirm** this will allow you to double-check your selections and click **Proceed**. 

Once completed Expensify will create a new workspace with your chosen configurations.
