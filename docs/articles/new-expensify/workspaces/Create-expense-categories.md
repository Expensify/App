<div id="new-expensify" markdown="1">

In Expensify, categories refer to the **chart of accounts, GL accounts, expense accounts**, and other line-item details that help code expenses for accounting and financial reporting.

An admin can manually create categories for a workspace, or they will be automatically imported if your workspace is connected to another platform such as QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, Intacct, Xero, or NetSuite. These imported categories can be enabled or disabled to use as categories for expenses added to Expensify. Additionally, Expensify will learn how you apply categories to specific merchants over time and apply them automatically.

# Enable or disable categories

Once you have manually added your categories or automatically imported them from a connected accounting system, you can enable or disable the categories to determine whether they can be added to expenses. 

{% include info.html %}
After connecting an accounting system, Expensify automatically imports charts of accounts, GL accounts, expense accounts, and additional details into your workspace as **disabled** categories. Workspace admins can enable these categories to make them available for workspace members to add to their expenses.

# Automatic Expensify categories

Over time, Expensify learns how you categorize specific merchants and automatically applies that category to the merchant in the future. 
- If you change a category, Expensify learns that correction over time as well. However, changing a category on one expense does not change it for other expenses that have already been assigned the category.
- Any expense rules for your workspace take priority over Expensify’s automatic categories. 
- Expensify won’t automatically add a category to an expense if it is already manually assigned a category. 

{% include faq-begin.md %}
**Can I edit my categories on a submitted expense report?**

Yes, you can edit categories on an expense you have submitted until the expense is approved or reimbursed. 

Approvers can also edit categories on the submitter’s behalf, even after approval. If you are an approver reviewing a report that wasn’t submitted to you, you’ll see the option to take control of the report and then you can change the category. 

**Can I see an audit trail of category changes on an expense?** 

Yes. When a category is manually edited, Expensify will log the change in the related workspace chat. 

**If I change categories in my accounting system, what happens to categories in the workspace?**

If a category is disabled in the accounting system, it will be removed from the workspace’s categories list in the workspace. However, the disabled category will remain on approved and drafted expense reports that it has been previously added to. An admin can change the category on an approved or reimbursed expense, and anyone can change the category on an unapproved expense.
