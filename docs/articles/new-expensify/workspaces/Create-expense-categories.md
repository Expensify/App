In Expensify, categories represent your **chart of accounts, GL accounts, expense accounts**, or other financial coding used for reporting and accounting.

Admins can manually create categories for a workspace, or they can be imported automatically when connected to an accounting platform like QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, or Intacct. Once imported, categories can be enabled or disabled as needed. Over time, Expensify also learns how you apply categories to specific merchants and suggests them automatically.

# Apply Categories Automatically

Expensify will learn your category preferences over time and apply them automatically based on the merchant.

- If you manually change a category, Expensify remembers the update.
- Existing category assignments are not retroactively changed.
- Workspace-level expense rules override automatic category assignments.
- If a category is already set manually, Expensify won’t override it.

# FAQ

## Can I Edit Categories on a Submitted Expense Report?

Yes, until an expense is approved or reimbursed. Approvers can also edit categories—even post-approval—by taking control of the report.

## Can I See an Audit Trail of Category Changes?

Yes. When a category is manually edited, the change is logged in the related expense chat.

## What Happens if a Category Is Disabled in My Accounting System?

It will be removed from the workspace’s category list. However, it will remain visible on previously submitted or drafted reports where it was already applied.

## How Can My Employees See the GL Codes?

GL codes are not visible to employees by default. If visibility is required, consider including the GL code in the category name itself.
