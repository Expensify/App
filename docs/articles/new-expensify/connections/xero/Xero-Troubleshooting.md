If your expense reports aren’t exporting to Xero, this guide covers common causes and how to fix them.

# Report didn’t export automatically to Xero

When an error occurs during an auto-export:

- You'll receive an email with details about the error
- The report will show a red dot in the related **Chat** thread
- A message will post in the Workspace’s **#admins** chat, linking to the **Accounting** settings with the error reason

These errors prevent automatic exports. You’ll need to correct the issue and export the report manually.

## How to resolve it

1. Open the expense and fix any required details.
2. From the top of the report, select **Export**.
3. Choose **Xero** to manually export the report.

# Can't manually export a report

You can only export reports that are in one of these states:

- **Approved**
- **Closed**
- **Reimbursed**

If a report is still **Open**, you’ll see a message indicating the data isn’t ready for export.

## How to resolve it

1. Open the report and review its status.
2. If the report is **Open**, submit it.
3. If the report is **Processing**, it must be approved by an admin or approver.
4. Once approved, go to the top of the report, select **Export**, and choose **Xero**.
