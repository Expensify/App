# FAQ

## How do I know if a report successfully exported to Xero?

When a report exports successfully, a message is posted in the related Expensify Chat room.

## What happens if I manually export a report that has already been exported?

When an admin manually exports a report, Expensify will warn them if the report has already been exported. If the admin chooses to export it again, it will create a duplicate report in Xero. You will need to delete the duplicate entries from within Xero.

## What happens to existing reports that have already been approved and reimbursed if I enable Auto Sync?

- If Auto Sync was disabled when your Workspace was linked to Xero, enabling it won’t impact existing reports that haven’t been exported.
- If a report has been exported and reimbursed via ACH, it will be automatically marked as paid in Xero during the next sync.
- If a report has been exported and marked as paid in Xero, it will be automatically marked as reimbursed in Expensify during the next sync.
- If a report has not yet been exported to Xero, it won’t be automatically exported.
