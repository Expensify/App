2. Choose your preferences:

# Step 2: Set Up Export Settings

Export settings determine how Expensify sends data to Xero.

1. Under the Xero connection, click **Export**.
2. Configure the following:

- **Preferred exporter** – Assign a Workspace Admin to automatically receive reports to export.  
  - Other Workspace Admins can still export to Xero.  
  - If card-specific export settings are configured under your domain, the Preferred Exporter must be a Domain Admin.

- **Export out-of-pocket expenses as** – All out-of-pocket expenses are exported as purchase bills (not editable).
- **Purchase bill date** – Choose to use the date of the last expense, submitted date, or export date.
- **Export invoices as** – All invoices export as sales invoices (not editable).
- **Export company card expenses as** – All company card expenses are exported as bank transactions (not editable).
- **Xero bank account** – Select the account to post non-reimbursable expenses.

# Step 3: Configure Advanced Settings

Advanced settings control sync frequency and automation.

1. Under the Xero connection, click **Advanced**.
2. Choose your options:

- **Auto-sync** – Automatically keep Xero and Expensify in sync. Reports are exported after approval, and reimbursable reports post to Xero once reimbursed.
- **Set purchase bill status** – Choose between:
  - Draft
  - Awaiting Approval
  - Awaiting Payment
- **Sync reimbursed reports**—Mark reimbursed reports in Expensify as Paid in Xero. This requires selecting a Xero reimbursement account.
- **Xero bill payment account** – Required if **Sync reimbursed reports** is enabled.
- **Xero invoice collections account** – Select the account where paid invoices appear.

# FAQ

## How do I know if a report was exported successfully to Xero?

When a report exports successfully, Concierge posts a confirmation message in the related Expensify Chat room.

## What happens if I export a report that was already exported?

Expensify warns you if the report has already been exported. If you proceed, it creates a duplicate in Xero, which you'll need to delete manually.

## Will existing reports be affected when I enable auto-sync?

- Reports already exported won’t be re-exported.
- Reimbursed reports marked as Paid in Xero will also show as Paid in Expensify after sync.
- If a report was reimbursed via ACH, the Paid status syncs to Xero.
- Reports not yet exported won’t be affected unless exported manually.
