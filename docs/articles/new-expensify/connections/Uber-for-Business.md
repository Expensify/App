Connect your Expensify workspace to Uber for Business to automatically import Uber Rides and Uber Eats receipts for your team. This guide walks you through setup, employee management, and receipt import.

# Connect the Uber for Business Integration

## Step 1: Enable Receipt Partners in your Workspace
1. Go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > More features**.
2. Toggle on **Receipt partners**.
3. Once enabled, a new **Receipt partners** section will appear in the left-hand menu.

## Step 2: Connect Uber for Business
1. Go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Receipt partners**
3. Click **Connect** next to Uber for Business.
4. Authorize or create your Uber for Business (U4B) account in the new browser tab that opens.
5. When complete, the tab will close, and a list of workspace members not yet invited to U4B will appear.
6. Confirm which workspace members should be invited to use the connection (they’ll all be selected by default).

If your connection fails or expires, a warning will appear under **Workspaces > Receipt partners > Uber for Business**. To resolve the error, click the three-dot menu and choose **Enter credentials** to reconnect.

# Manage the Uber for Business connection

## Manage invites

When you first connect to Uber for Business, all workspace members will be invited by default. To manually invite members later:

1. Go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Receipt partners**
2. Click **Manage invites**.
3. From here, you can filter the members list, invite new employees, or resend any outstanding invites that haven't been accepted yet.

As an admin, you can also automatically keep your Uber for Business roster in sync with your Expensify workspace members list. We offer two configurable settings:

- Invite new workspace members to Uber for Business
- Deactivate removed workspace members from Uber for Business

## Configure a Centralized Billing Account (Optional)

We will automatically detect if your Uber for Business organization uses centralized billing, but you’ll still need to choose which Expensify account should receive the receipts:

1. Go to **Workspaces > Receipt partners > Uber for Business**.
2. Click **Edit** next to **Central billing account**.
3. Select a workspace member (The workspace owner is selected by default).
4. Save your changes.

# Disconnect Uber for Business

1. Go to **Workspaces > Receipt partners > Uber for Business**.
2. Click the three-dot menu.
3. Select **Disconnect** and confirm in the modal window.


# FAQs

## Can I use this integration in Expensify Classic?
The Uber for Business connection can only be connected and managed in New Expensify, but once connected, imported Uber receipts will show up in both New Expensify and Expensify Classic.

## Can I invite employees again if they didn’t accept the first time?
Yes! Go to **Manage invites**, find their name or email, and click **Resend**.

## What do the different buttons and badges on the Manage Invites page mean?
- **Invite button** – The employee has never been invited.
- **Resend button** - The employee has been invited, but has not yet accepted.
- **Pending badge** – The invite has been accepted, but additional approval is required within Uber.
- **Linked badge** – The employee has accepted the invite.
- **Suspended badge** – The employee’s Uber account is linked, but has been temporarily suspended by Uber (i.e rider disputes, etc).
