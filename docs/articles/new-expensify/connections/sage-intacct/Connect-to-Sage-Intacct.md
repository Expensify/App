description: Integrate Sage Intacct with Expensify
order: 1
---

The Sage Intacct integration allows for automated syncing and reduces manual entries. The integration allows you to import your standard dimensions (like department, class, location, customer, and project/job) as well as user-defined dimensions for selection in Expensify.

The features available for the Expensify connection with Sage Intacct vary based on your Sage Intacct subscription. The features may still be visible in Expensify even if you don't have access, but you will receive an error if the feature isn't available with your subscription.

The Sage Intacct integration is only available on the Control plan.

# Step 1a: Create a web services user (Connecting with User-based permissions)

To connect to Sage Intacct, you’ll need to create a special web services user (please note that Sage Intacct does not charge extra for web services users).

1. Go to **Company > Web Services Users > New**
2. Configure the user as outlined below:
    - **User ID**: “xmlgateway_expensify”
    - **Last Name and First Name:** “Expensify”
    - **Email Address:** Your shared accounting team email
    - **User Type:** “Business”

# FAQ

## Why wasn't my report automatically exported to Sage Intacct?
There are a number of factors that can cause auto-export to fail. If this happens, you will find the specific export error in the report comments for the report that failed to export. Once you’ve resolved any errors, you can manually export the report to Sage Intacct.

## Can I export negative expenses to Sage Intacct?
Yes, you can export negative expenses to Sage Intacct. If you are exporting out-of-pocket expenses as expense reports, then the total of each exported report cannot be negative.
