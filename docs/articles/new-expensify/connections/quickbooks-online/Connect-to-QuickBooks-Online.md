**Why do I see a red dot next to my connection?** 
If there is an error with your connection, you’ll see a red dot next to Accounting in the left menu. When you click Accounting, you’ll also see a red dot displayed next to the QuickBooks Online connection card.

This may occur if you incorrectly enter your QuickBooks Online login information when trying to establish the connection. To resubmit your login details,
1. Click the three-dot menu to the right of the QuickBooks Online connection.
2. Click **Enter credentials**.
3. Enter your Intuit login details (the login information you use for QuickBooks Online) to establish the connection.
