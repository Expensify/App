2. Scroll down and click **Workspaces** in the left menu. 
3. Select the workspace the travel is booked under.
4. Tap into the booking to see more details. 
5. Click **Trip Support**.

If there is an unexpected change to the itinerary (for example, a flight cancellation), Expensify’s travel partner **Spotnana** will reach out to the traveler to provide updates on those changes.
