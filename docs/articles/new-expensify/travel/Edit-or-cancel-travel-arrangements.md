You can review your travel arrangements any time by opening the Trip chat in your inbox. For example, if you booked a flight to San Francisco, a “Trip to San Francisco” chat will be automatically added to your chat inbox.  

To edit or cancel a travel arrangement,
1. Open your Inbox.  
2. Select the trip in the left hand panel. 
3. Select the leg of the travel you want to update. 
4. Click Modify Trip.
5. Select Modify or Cancel. 

If there is an unexpected change to the itinerary (for example, a flight cancellation), Expensify’s travel partner **Spotnana** will reach out to the traveler to provide updates on those changes.
