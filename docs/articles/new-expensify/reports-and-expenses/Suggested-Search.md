# FAQ

## What if I don't see the Submit, Approve, Pay, or Export options?

Suggested searches only appear when:
- You have reports that require those actions.
- You have the correct workspace permissions (e.g., Admin, Approver).

## Can I use Suggested Search across multiple workspaces?

Not yet. The **Workspace filter** is currently single-select. Multi-workspace support is planned for a future update.

## What is the difference between Explore and To-do?

- **Explore** = General browsing (e.g., Expenses, Chats)
- **To-do** = Personalized actions based on your role (e.g., Submit, Approve, Pay, Export)
