# Suggested Search in New Expensify

**Navigation: Left-hand Menu > Reports > Expense Reports > Suggested Search**.

Suggested Search surfaces key report actions in your **Reports** page so you can:
- Submit expenses waiting on you
- Approve reports that need your review
- Pay approved reports ready for reimbursement


These shortcuts are personalized based on your role and workspace configuration, helping you process reports in batches without an advanced search.

Suggested searches only appear when:
- You have reports that require those actions.
- You have the correct workspace permissions (e.g., Admin, Approver).

## Can I use Suggested Search across multiple workspaces?

Not yet. The **Workspace filter** is currently single-select. Multi-workspace support is planned for a future update.

## What is the difference between Explore and To-do?

- **Explore** = General browsing (e.g., Expenses, Chats)
- **To-do** = Personalized actions based on your role (e.g., Submit, Approve, Pay)
