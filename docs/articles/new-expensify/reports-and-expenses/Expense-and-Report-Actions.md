Expense and report actions vary depending on the member role (submitter, approver, payer, admin) and the report's status (draft, outstanding, approved, done, paid). This guide outlines what to expect when reviewing, approving, paying, exporting, or managing expenses and reports based on varying workspace settings and report status.

# Expense and Report Actions

Report actions guide the submitter, approver, and payer regarding the report's status and what actions need to be taken next. 

## Understanding Primary vs. Secondary Actions

| **Action Type** | **What It Means** | **Examples** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Primary actions** | Actions that require your attention and drive the report forward. These are always visible at the top of a report or in the reports list. | Submit, Approve, Pay, Export |
| **Secondary actions (More menu)** | Optional tools and adjustments that help manage or troubleshoot an expense or report. Appear in the More menu depending on the state, role, or integration settings. | Hold, Delete, Change workspace, Mark as exported |

# FAQ

## Who can change a report's workspace?

- **Submitters**: Until the report is approved  
- **Approvers**: Until they approve the report  
- **Admins**: Until the report is exported

## What happens if an export fails?

If a report doesn’t export automatically or manually, you’ll see an error message with instructions on what to do next. You can try exporting it again using the same button.

The process works just like manual exports for automatic export issues, so you can fix the problem and retry the export on your own.

## Why can’t I cancel a payment?

The **Cancel payment** option is only available for in-app payments and only before Expensify starts processing the withdrawal. This is usually between 12 PM and 3 PM Pacific Time each day.

This option won't be available if the payment was made manually outside of Expensify. In that case, use **Unapprove** instead.
