# Who can use search operators in Expensify

Anyone can use search operators when filtering data in features like Expenses, Reports, Invoices, Chats, and Tasks. This is especially helpful for Workspace Admins, accountants, and finance teams looking to analyze or export targeted data.

---

# Where to find search operators in Expensify

You can use search operators directly in:

- The **Expenses**, **Reports**, or **Invoices** navigation tabs on the left (web)
- The **Search** bar at the top of your workspace inbox
- Inside advanced filters for Reports, Tasks, or Chats

---

# Key rules for using search operators

Here are the core rules and behaviors you’ll use across all filters:

- `field:value` is the basic format.
- Use commas for **OR**: `status:drafts,outstanding`.
- Chaining fields means **AND**: `amount>50 status:approved`.
- Use `-` to negate: `-has:receipt`.
- Add quotes for exact phrases: `description:"team lunch"`.
- Supports relative dates: `date:this-week`.
- Autocomplete kicks in after typing `:`.

# Type and type-agnostic filters

These filters help you refine searches across object types, workspaces, or user-specific data.

| **Syntax**       | **Description**                                                               | **Example**                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `type:`          | Filter by object type: `expense`, `chat`, `invoice`, `trip`, or `task`       | `type:expense`               |
| `workspace:`     | Filter by workspace name (wrap in quotes if the name has spaces)             | `workspace:"Acme Inc."`      |
| `from:`          | Filter by sender (email, phone, display name, or `me` for yourself)          | `from:alice@acme.com`        |
| `to:`            | Filter by recipient (email, phone, display name, or `me` for yourself)       | `to:me`                      |

**Note:** Quotes are required when filtering by names with spaces, such as `workspace:"Sales Team"`.

# FAQ

## Can I combine filters from different types?

Yes, but only when they make sense together. For example, combining `type:expense` with `merchant:` and `amount:` works, but mixing in `assignee:` (a task filter) won’t return results.

## What happens if I enter an invalid operator?

If the search operator isn’t recognized, the system will ignore it and return results based on any valid parts of the query.

## Do I need to use quotes for everything?

Only use quotes for values that include spaces or exact phrases, like `description:"client lunch"` or `in:"#general"`.
