Understand what each report status means, what actions are available, and how to manage reports, invoices, and IOUs in New Expensify.

# Report Statuses

Each report status reflects a different stage in the reporting workflow:

- **Open**: The report is a draft. You can still add or remove expenses.
- **Submitted**: The report is awaiting approval from another person.
- **Processing**: The report is in progress—under review, held, or partially completed.
- **Approved**: The report is approved and ready for payment or export. This is the final status for reports containing only non-reimbursable (e.g. company card) expenses.
- **Reimbursed**: The report has been paid. All actions are complete.
- **Closed**: The report is locked. No further edits or deletions can be made. This is the final status for non-approvable reports.

# Report Action Buttons

## Green Button = Primary Action  
Green buttons are dynamic and change depending on your role and the report’s status.

You’ll see a green button when a key action is available, such as **Submit**, **Approve**, **Pay**, or **Export**.

## Grey Button = More Actions  
The grey **More** button is always visible in the report header. Tap it to access additional options, including:

- Hold / Unhold
- Unapprove
- Download as CSV
- Change Workspace
- View Details
- Delete
- Decline

# Context-Specific Buttons

Depending on the report status and your role, the primary action button may say:

- **Submit**: The report is ready to submit.
- **Review**: The report contains holds, violations, or duplicate warnings.
  - A red dot means something needs attention.
- **Approve**: The report is ready for approval.
- **Pay**: The report has been approved and is ready for reimbursement.
- **Export**: Send the approved report to your accounting system.
- **View**: No further action is required; you have view-only access.

# Special Actions

## Held Expenses  
If you're an Approver who placed a hold, you'll see a green **Remove hold** button. Other users will see a grey **Review** button.

## Decline Expenses  
If you're an Approver reviewing an expense that shouldn't have been submitted, you can **Decline** it back to the submitter with a reason. The decline reason will be added to the report. The expense can later be marked as resolved and resubmitted for approval.

## Duplicate Expenses
- Submitters: See **Review Duplicates** if duplicates are suspected.
- Approvers: See **Resolve Duplicates** to take action.

## Receipt Matching  
If Expensify cannot detect a potential match between a SmartScanned receipt and a card transaction, you'll see **Mark as Cash** as the suggested next step for the receipt.

# Moving Expenses or Reports

- **To move a single expense**: Open the expense, then update the **Report** field to select another Open report.
- **To move a report to another workspace**: Tap **More > Change Workspace**.

---

# Deleting a Report

- **To delete a report**: Go to an **Open** report and tap **More > Delete**.
  - If the report contains only one expense, that expense will also be deleted.
  - If the report contains multiple expenses, they will become **Unreported** and available to add to a new report.

# Actions for Invoices and IOUs

## Invoices - As the Receiver
- Use **Pay** to reimburse.
- Tap **More** for options like **Download** and **View Details**.

## Invoices - As the Sender
- Choose **Export** or **Mark as exported**.
- **Delete** and **Change Workspace** are not available.

## IOUs - As the Receiver
- You can **Pay**, **Decline**, **Change Workspace**, or **Download**.

## IOUs - As the Sender
- **Change Workspace** converts the IOU into a regular expense report on the selected workspace.

# FAQ

## Where is the Submit or Approve button?  
If no green button appears, it means no immediate action is required. Tap the **More** button to find available options.

## Can I delete reports?  
Yes—if the report is **Open** or **Processing**. **Closed** reports cannot be deleted.

## Can I view report details?  
Yes. Tap the report title or select **View Details** from the **More** menu.
