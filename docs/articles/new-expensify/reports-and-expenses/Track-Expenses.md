# Locate and Manage Tracked Expenses

After tracking an expense, it appears in an **Expense Chat** in the left-hand navigation menu.

Within the Expense Chat, you can:
- **Submit it to someone** – Send it for approval or processing.
- **Categorize it** – Assign it to a category for better organization.
- **Share it with my accountant** – Grant access to financial contacts.
- **Nothing for now** – Leave it as-is for later.

You can also find tracked expenses this way:

1. From the left-hand menu, go to **Reports > Expenses**.
2. Use filters to narrow your search by date, amount, or category.
