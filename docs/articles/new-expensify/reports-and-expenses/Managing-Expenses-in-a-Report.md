Managing expenses in reports helps you keep everything organized and ready for approval, payment, or export. This guide covers adding, moving, deleting, and editing expenses, as well as understanding audit trails and collaboration.

# Managing Expenses in a Report

## Who can edit or modify expenses in a report
- **Edit expenses on a report**: The member who created the report and Workspace Admins.
- **Add expenses to a report**: Only the member who created the report.
- **Remove expenses from a report**: Only the member who created the report.
- **Delete an expense**: Only the member who created that specific expense.

To edit expenses in Approved or Paid reports, a workspace admin will need to unapprove the report first.

3. Then select **More** > **Unapprove**.

After it’s unapproved:
  - The member can select **More** > **Undo Submit**.
  - They can now edit or remove expenses before resubmitting.

**Important**: If the report was exported to an accounting system, delete the exported data there before exporting again.

## Understanding the Expense Table

Each report includes an expense table showing:
  - Date
  - Merchant
  - Category
  - Amount
  - Workspace violations (if applicable)

Clicking a row opens the full expense details.

## Comments and Collaboration

Every report has a comment thread where you can:
  - Add comments below the expense table or on individual expenses
  - Use @mentions to notify teammates
  - Upload documents to support conversations

Comments update live for everyone with access to the report.

## System Messages and Audit History

Reports include a complete audit trail of every action (submit, approve, pay, export, etc.) in the comment thread. Expenses also log a history of edits, making it easy to track compliance and troubleshooting.

# FAQ

## Why can’t I find a report I just created?

You may be filtered into a different workspace or be using a mismatched search term. Clear filters or use a broader search.

## Why can’t I submit a report?

  - The report has no expenses.
  - The report is already submitted.
  - Expenses are still SmartScanning or pending Expensify Card transactions.

**Solution**: Add at least one completed expense, or wait for scanning/transactions to finish.

## Why can’t I move or delete expenses from a report?

  - You don’t have permission to edit the report.
  - The report is approved or paid.

**Solution**: Ask a Workspace Admin to unapprove the report, or retract it if you submitted it.
