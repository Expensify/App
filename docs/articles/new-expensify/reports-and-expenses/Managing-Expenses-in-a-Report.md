# Managing Expenses in a Report

## Add Expenses to a Report

You can add expenses to a report in two ways:

### Create a new expense
1. Open the draft report.
2. Select **Add expense** > **Create new expense**.
3. Enter the expense details and click **Save**.
4. The new expense appears instantly in the report.

### Add existing unreported expenses
1. Select **Add expense** > **Add unreported expenses**.
2. Select one or more expenses.
3. Click **Add to report**.

**Tip:** To add additional expenses later, go to **More > Add expense**.

## Edit Expenses in Approved or Paid Reports

Approved and Paid reports are locked for editing. To make changes:

1. Open the report (as an Admin).
2. Select **More > Cancel Payment** (if Paid).
3. Then select **More > Unapprove**.

After it's unapproved:
- The member can select **More > Undo Submit**.
- They can now edit or remove expenses before resubmitting.

**Important:** If the report was exported to an accounting system, delete the exported data from that system before exporting again. Unapproving a report doesn’t retract the export.

### Example

Taylor submits a report to Jordan. Jordan approves, pays, and exports it to NetSuite, then notices the report includes an unpaid invoice meant for the AP team. Jordan cancels the payment, unapproves the report, and Taylor undoes the submission to remove the invoice. Meanwhile, Jordan deletes the exported report from NetSuite, preparing it for fresh export.

## View the Expense Table in a Report

Every report includes an expense table. Each row shows:

- Date
- Merchant
- Category
- Amount
- Workspace violations (if applicable)

Clicking a row opens the full expense details in the side panel.

---

## Comments and Collaboration

Each report includes a comment thread to help track conversations and share documents.

### Key features:
- Add comments below the expense table or on individual expenses.
- Use **@mentions** to notify teammates.
- Upload documents to support conversations.
- Comments update live for everyone with access to the report.

## System Messages and Audit History

Reports include a complete audit trail of every action—submit, approve, pay, export, etc. -in the comment thread. Expenses also log a history of edits, making it easy to follow changes for compliance or troubleshooting.

## Why can’t I submit a report?

**Possible causes:**

- All expenses are still SmartScanning or pending Expensify Card transactions.

**Solutions:**

- Wait for SmartScan to finish or card transactions to post.

## Why can’t I move or delete expenses from a report?

**Possible causes:**
