Make sure your receipts are attached correctly to individual expenses for audit and accounting compliance. This guide walks through how to attach, verify, and troubleshoot receipts in New Expensify.

# How to attach receipts to expenses

## Who can attach receipts to expenses

- You’re the member who created the expense.
- You’re a Workspace Admin editing another member’s expense.
- The report is in a **unreported**, **draft** or **outstanding** state.

If a report is **Approved** or **Paid**, a Workspace Admin will need to unapprove it before making changes.

## Where to attach receipts to expenses

Receipts must be attached **directly to the individual expense**, not uploaded into the report comments.

- Attaching a receipt in a report comment does **not** link it to any expense.
- Auditors and accounting systems only recognize receipts that are linked at the **expense level**.

## How to attach receipts to expenses

**Web**
1. Open the expense.
2. Click the green **+** on the receipt icon.
3. Upload a new file or choose from existing receipts.

**Mobile**
1. Open the expense.
2. Click the green **+** on the receipt icon.
3. Take a photo or upload a file from your device gallery.

## When to use report comments for supporting documentation

Each expense can only have one receipt attached. If you have **additional supporting documents** that don’t belong directly on the expense, use the report comment thread to upload them.

**Examples of supporting docs to upload in comments:**
- An itemized restaurant receipt (if the expense has the final total with tip)
- Contracts or invoices related to reimbursed expenses
- Travel itineraries or booking confirmations

**Important:** Only the receipt attached to the expense is used for audits and exports. Anything in the report comments is considered supplemental.

## How to fix a missing or misplaced receipt

If a receipt was added to the report comments instead of the expense:

### Option 1: Reattach manually
1. Download the file from the comment.
2. Open the correct expense.
3. Select the green **+** and upload it directly.

### Option 2: Use SmartScan to create a new expense
1. Forward the receipt to **receipts@expensify.com** or upload it via the **Receipts** tab.
2. SmartScan will create a new expense.
3. Edit the SmartScanned expense or move it to the correct report.

## How to edit a receipt in an Approved or Paid report

If the report is locked:

1. (Admins only) Open the report.
2. Select **More > Cancel Payment** if Paid.
3. Select **More > Unapprove**.
4. The member can then select **More > Undo Submit**.
5. Now they can edit the expense and reattach the receipt.

**Note:** If the report was exported to accounting, delete the exported version before resubmitting.

# FAQ

## Why isn’t my receipt showing on the expense?
It was likely uploaded in the report comments. Receipts must be attached directly to the expense to show up properly.

## Can I attach one receipt to multiple expenses?
No. Each expense must have its own receipt. You can upload the same file multiple times if needed.

## Can someone else upload a receipt to my expense?
Only Workspace Admins or the expense owner can attach a receipt to an expense.

## Will the auditor see receipts added in report comments?
No. Only receipts attached to the expense itself are visible in audit logs, exports, and accounting reports.
