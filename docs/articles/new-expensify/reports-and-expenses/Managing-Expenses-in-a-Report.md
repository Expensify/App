# How Expenses Appear in the Report Table

Each report includes a table that shows all added expenses.

## What you’ll see in each row
- Date
- Merchant
- Category
- Amount
- Policy violations (if applicable)
- Clickable rows that open details in the side panel

## Behavior highlights
- New expenses are briefly highlighted when added.
- Checkboxes allow you to take group actions.
- Expenses are listed in reverse chronological order (newest first).

# Comments and How They Relate to Expenses

Every report has a comment thread for collaboration and context.

## Comment features
- The thread appears below the report table.
- Supports mentions, questions, and internal notes.
- Updates live for all members in the workspace.

## How comments relate to expenses
- Reference expenses manually (e.g., “Why is the $150 Uber charge included?”).
- Comments stay with the report, even if expenses are moved or deleted.
- Comments aren’t tied to a specific expense, but they’re context-aware.

**Note:** On an empty report, the layout shifts to show the comment thread more clearly.

# System Messages and Audit Trail

System messages like **“Expense moved”** or **“Report submitted”** appear in the same thread as comments to help keep a clear audit trail. This makes it easier to track changes and approval workflows.

# Troubleshooting the Reports Page

## Why Can’t I Find a Report I Just Created?

**Possible reasons:**
- You’re filtered into a different workspace.
- The report preview is in **Inbox > Workspace chat**.
- Your search term doesn’t match the report name.

**Solutions:**
- Clear filters and search again.
- Look in **Inbox > Workspace chat** for previews.
- Use broader or partial search terms.
- Confirm you’re in the right workspace.

## Why is the “Create report” Button Missing?

**Possible reasons:**
- You’re in a workspace not using New Expensify.
- You’re part of a free or personal workspace.

**Solutions:**
- Switch to a **Collect** or **Control** workspace.
- Make sure chat features are enabled.
- Ask a Workspace Admin to enable New Expensify or invite you to an eligible workspace.

---

## Why Can’t I Submit a Report?

**Possible reasons:**
- The report has no expenses.
- The workspace uses **instant submit**, and it already submitted.
- Expenses are incomplete, have policy violations, or are still SmartScanning.

**Solutions:**
- Add at least one valid expense.
- Check expense statuses (e.g., missing receipts).
- If **instant submit** is enabled, the report might auto-submit.

---

## Why Don’t I See All My Unreported Expenses?

**Possible reasons:**
- The expenses are already included in another report.
- Filters are hiding them.
- They’re from another workspace or were already submitted.

**Solutions:**
- Clear filters in the **Add expense** screen.
- Review other reports to avoid duplicates.
- Check your **Self DM** for unreported expenses.

---

## Why Can’t I Move or Delete Expenses From a Report?

**Possible reasons:**
- You don’t have permission to edit the report.
- The report has been submitted or is under review.

**Solutions:**
- Only the report creator can edit draft reports.
- Submitted reports are locked from edits.
- If allowed, withdraw the report or ask a Workspace Admin for help.

---

## Why is The Report Total Incorrect or Missing Expenses?

**Possible reasons:**
- Filters are hiding expenses.
- The page hasn’t updated fully.

**Solutions:**
- Refresh or hard reload the page.
- Clear any active filters.
- Check system messages for recent changes.
