# Receive an Invoice Payment

If you haven’t [connected a business bank account](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expenses-and-payments/Connect-a-Business-Bank-Account) yet, invoice payments will appear as an **Invoice balance** in your [Wallet](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expenses-and-payments/Set-up-your-wallet). 

Expensify will automatically transfer these funds once your bank account is connected.

# FAQ

## Why do I need a workspace to send an invoice?
A workspace is a set of settings for your business. Invoicing is a business feature, so it requires a workspace to configure and use.

## How do I communicate with the invoice recipient?
Expensify automatically notifies the recipient via email, SMS, and mobile app with payment instructions. Daily reminders are sent until the invoice is paid. A dedicated invoice chat room is also created between the sender, their workspace admins, and the payer for direct communication.

## Can invoices be exported to accounting integrations?
Yes. You can export invoices to any connected [accounting integration](https://help.expensify.com/new-expensify/hubs/connections/).

## Who can send and pay an invoice?
Only workspace admins can send invoices. Invoices can be paid by anyone, even if they don’t have an Expensify account.

## What happens if I disable invoicing later?
All past invoices and invoice chat rooms will remain visible, but workspace admins will no longer be able to send new invoices.

## Why am I getting an error after entering my website while connecting a business bank account?
For security reasons, we only support websites on private domains. If you get an error, your domain may not be recognized as private. Make sure you're using a business email with a private domain. If the issue continues, reach out to Concierge support for help.
