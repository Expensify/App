Expenses can be created through manual entry, tracking distance, or scanning a receipt. They can be submitted to an individual or to a workspace. For steps on creating and submitting expenses, check out [Create an Expense](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expenses-and-payments/Create-an-expense).

# Expenses Sent to an Individual (Not a Workspace)

When an expense is submitted to an individual (rather than on a workspace), it won't go through an approval process. It only needs to be paid. See [Pay an Expense](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expenses-and-payments/Pay-an-expense) for the payment steps.

# Expenses Submitted on a Workspace

When an expense is submitted on a workspace with an approval workflow configured, it must be approved before it can be paid.

**For each expense report, you can:**

- **Approve**: Confirm the expense is valid and ready to pay.
- **Unapprove**: Return the report to its previous state for additional edits.

**For each expense on a report, you can:**
- **Hold**: Temporarily delay approval of the individual expense if more information is needed.
- **Reject**: Remove the expense from the report and send back to the submitter with a reason. The rejected expense can be marked as resolved and resubmitted by the submitter. 

**To set up an approval workflow:**

1. In the navigation tabs (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Workflows**.
2. Create a custom workflow to route expenses to the appropriate approvers.

# Approve an Expense

1. You’ll receive an in-app and email notification when an expense is submitted.
2. Click the notification to review the expense in Expensify, or you can find the expense in your **Inbox**.
3. Review details like the receipt, amount, and description.
4. Click **Approve**.

**Note:** If the transaction is still pending (e.g., an Expensify Card or SmartScan expense), you must wait until the transaction posts before approving.

# Change Approver

**To add an approver:**

1. From the Report, open the **More** dropdown at the top of the expense.
2. Select **Change approver**.
3. Select **Add approver**.
4. Select the approver and save.
5. The approver you selected is now the current approver, and the prescribed workflow will continue after their approval. 

**To bypass approvers:**

1. From the Report, open the **More** dropdown at the top of the expense.
2. Select **Change approver**.
3. Select **Bypass approvers**.
4. You are now the final approver, and the prescribed workflow has been bypassed.

# Hold an Expense

**To place an expense on hold:**

1. In the navigation tabs (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), head to **Reports > Expenses**.
2. Locate the expense using the search bar or filters.
3. Click **View**.
4. Open the **More** dropdown at the top of the expense.
5. Select **Hold** and enter a reason (this will be added to the report).

**To take an expense off hold to approve:**

1. In the navigation tabs (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), head to **Reports > Expenses**.
2. Locate the held expense using the search bar or filters.
3. Click **View**.
4. Open the **More** dropdown at the top of the expense.
5. Select **Unhold**.

# Unapprove a report

1. In the navigation tabs (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), head to **Reports > Reports**.
2. Locate the report using the search bar or filters.
3. Click **View**.
4. Open the **More** dropdown at the top of the report.
5. Select **Unapprove**.

Unapproving a report returns it to the Processing state. The last approver will be notified and can then revise or reject expenses on the report.

**Note:** Paid reports cannot be unapproved. If the expense was already exported to accounting software, unapproving it may cause reconciliation issues. Be sure to remove the exported data before approving the expense again.

# Reject an expense

1. In the navigation tabs (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), head to **Reports > Expenses**.
2. Locate the expense using the search bar or filters.
3. Click **View**.
4. Open the **More** dropdown at the top of the expense.
5. Select **Reject** and enter a reason (this will be added to the report).

The rejected expense will be removed from the report, and the submitter will be notified. The rejection reason will be added to the expense. The expense can later be marked as resolved and resubmitted for approval.

# FAQ

## Why is an employee expense showing as pending?
Expensify Card expenses show as pending until the merchant posts them. This can take 1–3 business days. Hotel or rental car holds may take longer (up to 31 days for hotels).

## What are expense reports?
Expense reports group multiple expenses into one batch for review or payment. Draft reports collect new expenses automatically. You can check the status of an expense under **Reports > Expenses**.

## Why can’t I see “Bypass approvers”?
Only workspace admins can bypass the prescribed approval workflow. If “Prevent Self-Approval” is enabled, an admin cannot bypass approvals to approve their own report.
