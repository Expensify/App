# When to Submit to an Individual

Use this option for personal payments. The person receiving the expense will be notified via email or text and can pay directly through Expensify. You can also send expenses within a 1:1 chat.

# When to Submit to a Workspace

If you're submitting business expenses, send them to a workspace. This ensures proper coding, review, and approval through your company's configured workflow.

## Smart Receipt Detection

Expensify uses AI to detect suspicious or non-human receipts:

- **AI-generated receipts** – We'll flag receipts that appear to be artificially created.
- **Prohibited expenses** – If a receipt violates workspace rules, it will be flagged as soon as it's submitted.

This feature helps prevent policy violations and ensures accurate expense tracking from the moment of upload.
