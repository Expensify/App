## Smart Receipt Detection

Expensify uses AI to detect suspicious or non-human receipts:

- **AI-generated receipts** – We'll flag receipts that appear to be artificially created.
- **Prohibited expenses** – If a receipt violates workspace rules, it will be flagged as soon as it's submitted.

This feature helps prevent policy violations and ensures accurate expense tracking from the moment of upload.
