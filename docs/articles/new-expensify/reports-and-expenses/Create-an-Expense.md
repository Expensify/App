# FAQ

## What is Smart Receipt Detection?

Expensify uses AI to detect suspicious or non-human receipts:

- **AI-generated receipts** – We'll flag receipts that appear to be artificially created.
- **Prohibited expenses** – If a receipt violates workspace rules, it will be flagged as soon as it's submitted.

This feature helps prevent policy violations and ensures accurate expense tracking from the moment of upload.

## Can I attach multiple receipts to one expense?

No. Only one receipt image is allowed per expense. Combine receipts into a single PDF or attach additional files to the report.

## Can I edit an expense after submission?

Yes, as long as it hasn’t been paid. You can update fields like description or category, but not amount or date.

## Why is the recipient marked as “Hidden”?

If you're submitting to someone for the first time, their contact information will show as "hidden" until they respond.

## How do I enable camera access for mobile browsers so I can take photos of my receipts?

**Chrome:**
- Go to **Settings > Site settings > Camera > Allow** for Expensify.

**Safari:**
- Tap **aA > Website Settings > Camera > Allow**, then tap **Done** and refresh the page.
