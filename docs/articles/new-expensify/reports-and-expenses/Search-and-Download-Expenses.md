# FAQ

## Can I export in a different format, like PDF or XLS?

No, expense exports are only available in CSV format.

## Can I customize the columns in the CSV file?

No, the CSV download uses a fixed template and can't be customized.

## Can I select expenses or reports in bulk?

Yes! Use **Select multiple** or **Select all** to choose multiple items at once.  On mobile, just long-press an item to display these options.

## Why do I see a 404 error when clicking on the receipt image URL in the CSV export?

You must be logged into your Expensify account on the browser where the link is being opened. Receipt URLs are only accessible when logged into your Expensify account.
