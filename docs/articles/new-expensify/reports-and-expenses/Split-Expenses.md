# FAQ

## Why do I need to start a chat before splitting an expense?

The split feature is accessed through the chat thread. Starting a chat ensures you're connected with the person you're requesting money from and makes tracking and communication about the expense easier.

## How do recipients pay me back?

They can pay through Expensify Wallet if it's enabled, or settle the amount outside Expensify. You can continue the conversation in the chat to coordinate payment.
