You can add attendees to an expense to indicate who participated in a meal, meeting, or event. This is especially helpful when your company has per-person category limits, as Expensify can split the cost evenly across all attendees to help avoid violations.

# Resolve Category Limit Errors by Adding Attendees

If an expense exceeds a category limit set by your admin, you can resolve the issue by adding attendees.

1. Click the **Attendees** caret to open the attendee selector.
2. Add the attendees involved in the expense.
3. Expensify will automatically split the total cost across all attendees.
4. Once added, a dot will appear between the **Attendees** field and the **per-person amount**, making it easy for approvers to verify the distribution.
