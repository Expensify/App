If you submitted a report too early or need to make changes, you can easily update it by retracting the report using **Undo submit** or **Undo close**. This returns the report to an editable state.

# When to Retract a Report

This option is helpful when:
- You submitted a report too early.
- Expenses were added by mistake.
- Additional receipts or notes are needed.
- You want to move expenses to a different report.

You can retract reports with the following statuses:
- **Processing reports**: Only the submitter (or a Workspace Admin submitting their own report) can use **Undo submit**.
- **Closed reports**: Only **Workspace Admins** can use **Undo close**.

**Note:** Held expenses or violations won’t stop you from retracting a report.

# Retract a Processing Report

1. Open the report.
2. Tap the **More** menu (three dots in the top-right corner).
3. Tap **Undo submit**.
4. The report will change to **Open** and display a **Retracted** system message.

**Note:** Submitters won’t receive a notification when retracting their own report.

---

# Retract a Closed Report

1. Open the closed report.
2. Tap **More** > **Undo close**.
3. A system message confirms the report is reopened and editable.

**Note:** Only Workspace Admins can retract closed reports.

# Editing Expense Reports After Exporting to an Accounting System

Admins can still retract closed reports even if they’ve already been exported to an accounting system such as QuickBooks or NetSuite.

When you click **Undo close**, a warning modal will appear to let you know:
- Reopening the report may cause **data mismatches** between Expensify and the accounting software.
- Any edits made to the expense report **won’t sync** with the report that’s already been exported.

From there, you can choose:
- **Reopen report**: Confirms and returns the report to an editable state.
- **Cancel**: Dismisses the warning message without making changes to the expense report.

Once reopened, a Workspace Admin can fully edit the report—adding or deleting expenses, changing categories, and more.

# FAQ

## Can I remove an expense from a submitted report?

Yes. Retract the report, remove the expense, and then resubmit the updated report.

## Why can't I retract a report?

You can't retract a report that’s already been **approved** or **paid**.

## What happens if I retract and edit a report after it’s exported to our accounting system?

You’ll see a warning modal before reopening. Any edits won’t sync to the external system. If you make changes to the report, those will need to be manually reconciled in the accounting system.
