If you submitted a report too early or need to make changes, you can easily update it by retracting the report using **Retract**. This returns the report to an editable state.

**Note:** Report actions like creating, submitting, or retracting can only be done in your own account. If you need to help a teammate, consider asking them to add you as a [Copilot](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/settings/Copilot-Access). 

# When to Retract a Report

This option is helpful when:
- You submitted a report too early.
- Expenses were added by mistake.
- Additional receipts or notes are needed.
- You want to move expenses to a different report.

You can retract reports with the following statuses:
- **Outstanding reports**: Only the submitter (or a Workspace Admin submitting their own report) can use **Retract**.
- **Done reports**: Only **Workspace Admins** can use **Retract**.

**Note:** Held expenses or violations won’t stop you from retracting a report.

## How to retract an outstanding report

1. Open the report.
2. Tap the **More** menu (three dots in the top-right corner).
3. Tap **Retract**.
4. The report will change to **Draft** and display a **Retracted** system message.
   - You can only retract outstanding reports you submitted from your own account. Reports submitted by other members require CoPilot access to retract.

**Note:** Submitters won’t receive a notification when retracting their own report.

## How to retract a done report

1. Open the done report.
2. Tap **More** > **Retract**.
3. A system message confirms the report is retracted and editable.

**Note:** Only Workspace Admins can retract done reports. Submitters can't retract their own done report unless they're also an admin.

## Editing Expense Reports After Exporting to an Accounting System

Admins can still retract done reports even if they’ve already been exported to an accounting system such as QuickBooks or NetSuite.

When you click **Retract**, a warning modal will appear to let you know:
- Retracting the report may cause **data mismatches** between Expensify and the accounting software.
- Any edits made to the expense report **won’t sync** with the report that’s already been exported.

From there, you can choose:
- **Retract**: Confirms and returns the report to an editable state.
- **Cancel**: Dismisses the warning message without making changes to the expense report.

Once retracting, a Workspace Admin can fully edit the report—adding or deleting expenses, changing categories, and more.

# FAQ

## Can I remove an expense from a submitted report?

Yes. Retract the report, remove the expense, and then resubmit the updated report.

## Why can't I retract a report?

You can't retract a report that’s already been **approved** or **paid**.

## What happens if I retract and edit a report after it’s exported to our accounting system?

You’ll see a warning modal before retracting. Any edits won’t sync to the external system. If you make changes to the report, those will need to be manually reconciled in the accounting system.

## Can I edit or retract someone else’s outstanding report?

No. You can only retract outstanding reports you submitted from your own account. If you need to take these actions for another employee, ask them to add you as a [Copilot](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/settings/Copilot-Access). Admins can retract done reports for their colleagues.
