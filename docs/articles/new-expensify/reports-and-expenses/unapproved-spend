Tracking unapproved expenses helps ensure your financial reporting is accurate and complete. This article explains how to identify and export both out-of-pocket and company card expenses that haven’t yet been approved or paid.

# Track unapproved spend

2. Select the checkbox at the top-left of the list.
3. Click **Select all matching items**, then choose **Export**.
4. Open the CSV in Excel and use a pivot table to group by **Submitter** or **Card**.
