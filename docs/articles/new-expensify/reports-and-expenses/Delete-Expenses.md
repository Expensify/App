# The Expense Report is Submitted or Marked as "Done"

You’ll need to reopen the report first:

1. Tap **Undo submit** or **Undo close**.
2. Once reopened, follow the steps above to delete any eligible expenses.

**Note:** You can only undo reports that are in the **Closed** or **Processing** state. Reports that are **Approved** or **Paid** cannot be reopened.

# Deleting Company Card Expenses

Some company card expenses can’t be deleted if the card settings don’t allow it. This usually happens when the card was imported without the **Allow Deleting Transactions** setting enabled. Once **Allow Deleting Transactions** is enabled, any future imported expenses can be deleted normally.

To delete existing company card draft expenses:
1. From the left-hand menu, go to **Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Company cards**.
2. Unassign the card connected to the expenses you want to delete.
3. All **draft expenses** from that card will be removed automatically.

**Note:** Submitted expenses will stay attached to reports and cannot be deleted by unassigning the card.

⚠️ **Warning:** Unassigning a company card will permanently delete **all draft expenses** imported from that card. Submitted expenses will not be affected.

# FAQ

## Why can't I delete certain expenses?

Expenses tied to company cards without the **Allow deleting transactions** setting enabled cannot be deleted unless the card is unassigned.

## Can I reopen a report after it’s been approved or paid?

No, once a report is approved or paid, it cannot be reopened. Only reports in a **Closed** or **Processing** state can be reopened to delete the expenses.
