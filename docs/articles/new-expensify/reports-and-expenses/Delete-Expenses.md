Need to remove an expense in New Expensify? The steps differ depending on whether the report is still open or already submitted. This guide covers both personal and company card expenses.

# Delete Expenses

## If the Expense Report is Open

You can delete any out-of-pocket expense that hasn’t been submitted yet:

1. Go to the **Reports** tab.
2. Open the report containing the expense.
3. Select the checkbox next to the expense you want to delete.
4. Choose **Delete** from the drop-down menu.

## If the Expense Report is Submitted or Marked as `Done`

You’ll need to reopen the report first:

1. Tap **Undo submit** or **Undo close**.
2. Once reopened, follow the steps above to delete any eligible expenses.

**Note:** You can only undo reports that are in the **Closed** or **Processing** state. Reports that are **Approved** or **Paid** cannot be reopened.

## Deleting Company Card Expenses

Some company card expenses can’t be deleted if the card settings don’t allow it. This usually happens when the card was imported without the **Allow Deleting Transactions** setting enabled. Once **Allow Deleting Transactions** is enabled, any future imported expenses can be deleted normally.

To delete existing company card draft expenses:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > Workspace Name > Company cards**.
2. Unassign the card connected to the expenses you want to delete.
3. All **draft expenses** from that card will be removed automatically.

**Note:** Submitted expenses will stay attached to reports and cannot be deleted by unassigning the card.

⚠️ **Warning:** Unassigning a company card will permanently delete **all draft expenses** imported from that card. Submitted expenses will not be affected.

# FAQ

## Why can't I delete some expenses?

Expenses tied to company cards without the **Allow Deleting Transactions** setting enabled cannot be deleted unless the card is unassigned.

## Can I undo a report after it’s been approved or paid?

No, once a report is approved or paid, it cannot be reopened. Only reports in a **Closed** or **Processing** state can be undone.
