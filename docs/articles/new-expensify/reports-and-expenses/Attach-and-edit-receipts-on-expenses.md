Make sure your receipts are attached correctly to individual expenses for audit and accounting compliance. This guide explains how to attach, verify, and troubleshoot receipts in New Expensify — and when to use report comments for additional documentation.

# How to Attach and Verify Receipts on Expenses

## Who can attach receipts to an expense
- **Attach or replace a receipt**: The member who created the expense, or a Workspace Admin.
- **Edit a receipt in an Approved or Paid report**: Requires the report to be unapproved first (see below).

---

## Where to Attach Receipts for Audits and Exports

Receipts must be attached **directly to the expense** to be visible in:
- Audit trails
- Accounting exports
- PDF reports

Attaching receipts in the report comment thread does **not** link them to any expense and will not meet audit or export requirements.

## When to Use Report Comments for Supporting Documentation

Each expense can only have **one receipt** attached. If you have **additional documents**, like an itemized breakdown or supporting files, you can add those in the report comments.

### Examples:
- Attach the **credit card receipt** to the expense (shows the total, tip and payment method).
- Add the **itemized receipt** in the report comments (shows specific items ordered).
- Upload contracts, invoices, or confirmations that support reimbursed expenses.

**Reminder:** Only receipts attached to the expense count for audits, exports, and compliance.

# FAQ

## Why isn’t my receipt showing on the expense?
It was likely uploaded in the report comments. Receipts must be attached directly to the expense to appear properly.

## Can I attach one receipt to multiple expenses?
No. Each expense must have its own receipt. You can upload the same file more than once if needed.

## Can someone else upload a receipt to my expense?
Only the expense creator or a Workspace Admin can attach a receipt an expense.

## Will auditors see receipts added in report comments?
No. Receipts in the comments section are considered supplemental and are not included in audits, exports, or downloadable reports.

## Can I attach both the card and itemized restaurant receipts?
Yes. Attach the **card receipt** to the expense itself, and upload the **itemized receipt** in the report comments as supporting documentation.
