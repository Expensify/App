# Create and Send a Distance Expense

To submit a mileage-based expense:

1. **From the left-hand menu**, click the green **+** button and select **Create expense**.
2. Select **Distance** from the top row.
3. Enter your **Start** and **Finish** locations.
   - To include additional stops, click **Add stop**.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Choose a workspace from your recent options or search to select the correct one.
6. On the confirmation screen, review and confirm:
   - **Distance**
   - **Amount**
   - **Date**
   - (Optional) Add a **description**, **category**, or **tag**
7. Click **Create expense** to submit the mileage expense for approval.

A Workspace Admin will be notified of the expense and, depending on your workspace settings, can reimburse you through Expensify or another method.

# FAQ

## Is there an easy way to reuse recent locations?
Yes! When selecting the **Start** and **Finish** addresses, recently used locations will appear for quick selection.

## How do I create a round-trip expense?
To create a round-trip distance expense, enter the same location for both the starting point and destination, and add one or more waypoints in between. 

For example, if you're starting and ending in San Francisco but making a stop in Los Angeles, you’d enter: **San Francisco → Los Angeles → San Francisco**.
