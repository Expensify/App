2. Select **Distance** from the top row.
3. Enter your **Start** and **Finish** locations.
   - To include additional stops, click **Add stop**.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Choose a workspace from your recent options or search to select the correct one.
6. On the confirmation screen, review and confirm:
   - **Distance**
   - **Amount**
   - **Date**
   - (Optional) Add a **description**, **category**, or **tag**
7. Click **Create expense** to submit the mileage expense for approval.

To submit a distance-based expense by entering the distance manually:

1. Click the green “+” sign and select **Track distance** from any page in the app or directly  
from an expense chat
2. Choose the **Manual** tab
3. Enter the number of miles or kilometers you need to be reimbursed for

# How Reimbursement Rates Are Determined

## Submitting to a workspace

If you're submitting the expense to a workspace:

- You'll choose from the distance rates that are enabled on that workspace.
- The **Workspace Admin** manages available rates.
- The **unit** (miles or kilometers) depends on the workspace’s distance unit setting.

## Not submitting to a workspace

If you're not submitting to a workspace (e.g., personal tracking):

- Expensify will apply a **default rate** based on your **reporting currency**.
   - Example: For USD, the rate is based on the current IRS reimbursement rate and uses **miles**.
   - Other currencies use sensible defaults determined by Expensify’s internal research.
- You can’t customize this rate unless you upgrade to a workspace.
- Default distance rates are updated annually.

# FAQ

## Is there an easy way to reuse recent locations?

Yes! When selecting the **Start** and **Finish** addresses, recently used locations will appear for quick selection.

## How do I create a round-trip expense?

To create a round-trip distance expense, enter the same location for both the starting point and destination, and add one or more waypoints in between.

For example, if you're starting and ending in San Francisco but making a stop in Los Angeles, enter:
**San Francisco → Los Angeles → San Francisco**

## How is the expense calculated?

The amount is automatically calculated by multiplying the distance by the workspace’s rate. If no workspace is assigned to the expense, a default rate is applied based on your default currency. Distance expenses are rounded to two decimal places.

## Can I edit an expense after I’ve created it?

Yes! You can edit the expense before it is approved.

## Can I split a distance expense?

Only map-based distance expenses can be split, manual distance expenses are not available for splitting. If you need a manual distance expense split with another user, you can each create your own expense for half the distance each.

## Can I update the distance unit or rate?

The distance unit and rate can only be updated at the workspace level, not at the expense level. If you need these updated, you will need to speak with an admin.

## Can I move my distance expense to a new workspace?

Yes, you can do this before the expenses have been approved. However, be aware that doing so will automatically update the distance rate and unit based on the new workspace.

## What if I enter 0 miles or kilometers?

You cannot create a distance expense for 0 miles or kilometers. If you do, you’ll see this error:  
**“Please enter a valid distance before continuing.”**
