# Create and Send a Distance Expense

To submit a mileage-based expense:

1. From the left-hand menu, click the green **+** button and select **Create expense**.
2. Select **Distance** from the top row.
3. Enter your **Start** and **Finish** locations.
   - To include additional stops, click **Add stop**.
4. Click **Next**.
5. Choose a workspace from your recent options or search to select the correct one.
6. On the confirmation screen, review and confirm:
   - **Distance**
   - **Amount**
   - **Date**
   - (Optional) Add a **description**, **category**, or **tag**
7. Click **Create expense** to submit the mileage expense for approval.

A Workspace Admin will be notified of the expense and, depending on your workspace settings, can reimburse you through Expensify or another method.

# How Reimbursement Rates Are Determined

## Submitting to a workspace

If you're submitting the expense to a workspace:

- You'll choose from the distance rates that are enabled on that workspace.
- The **Workspace Admin** manages available rates.
- The **unit** (miles or kilometers) depends on the workspace’s distance unit setting.

## Not submitting to a workspace

If you're not submitting to a workspace (e.g., personal tracking):

- Expensify will apply a **default rate** based on your **reporting currency**.
   - Example: For USD, the rate is based on the current IRS reimbursement rate and uses **miles**.
   - Other currencies use sensible defaults determined by Expensify’s internal research.
- You can’t customize this rate unless you upgrade to a workspace.
- Default distance rates are updated annually.

# FAQ

## Is there an easy way to reuse recent locations?

Yes! When selecting the **Start** and **Finish** addresses, recently used locations will appear for quick selection.

## How do I create a round-trip expense?

To create a round-trip distance expense, enter the same location for both the starting point and destination, and add one or more waypoints in between.

For example, if you're starting and ending in San Francisco but making a stop in Los Angeles, enter:  
**San Francisco → Los Angeles → San Francisco**
