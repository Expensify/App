Duplicate Detection helps prevent accidental double-submission of expenses by flagging entries within a member's account that have the same **date** and **amount**. When a potential duplicate is found, a red dot appears in the left-hand menu or next to the chat where the expense lives, and the expense is placed on **hold**.

ðŸ”’ **Note:** Duplicate Detection is available on Collect and Control plans only.

# Manage and Resolve Duplicate Expenses

1. From the left-hand menu, click the red dot or open the chat containing the flagged expense.
2. Click the green **Review duplicates** button at the top of the expense.
3. Review the list of matched expenses flagged as duplicates.
4. Choose how to proceed:
   - **Keep all**: Retains all matched expenses and removes the hold.
   - **Keep this one**: Keeps the current expense and discards the duplicates.
5. If there are differences between the expenses (like categories or tags), choose which values to keep.
6. Confirm your selection.

The hold is removed, and the expenses are either merged or kept separately, depending on your choice.

# FAQ

## Can I review a discarded duplicate later? 
Yes, approvers can review previously discarded duplicates to ensure accuracy and detect potential fraud.

## Can I edit a duplicate expense after resolving it?
Yes, you can edit a duplicate expense once it has been resolved, but only after the hold is removed.

## Will two SmartScanned receipts from the same day with the same amount be flagged?
Yes, unless:
- The expenses were split from a single expense.
- They were imported from a credit card.
- They came from matching email receipts with different timestamps.
