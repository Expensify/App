Get familiar with the Reports page in New Expensify. This guide walks you through using report previews, tables, filters, and smart suggestions to streamline your expense-tracking workflow.

The **Reports page** shows a full list of your reports and related expenses. While the Inbox highlights what needs attention, this page helps you explore, filter, and export your data.

# Report Previews

Report previews are summaries shown directly in your workspace chat in the **Inbox**. They let you check a report’s status without opening it.

## Visibility of Report Previews
- Visible to **all members** in the workspace chat  
- Only the **creator** sees interactive options like **Add expense**  
- **Workspace admins** can approve and pay the report

## Preview Details
- Report title and status (e.g. Approved, Paid)  
- Up to 10 expense previews with:
  - Date, category, tag
  - Merchant or description
  - Receipt thumbnail  
- Carousel navigation  
- **+X more** link if there are over 10 expenses  
- Action button: Submit, Approve, Pay, etc., depending on the role

## Preview Behavior and Updates
Previews update **in real time** as expenses are added. If a report is deleted, the preview is removed from the workspace chat

**When someone comments on a report:**
- A **Comments** section will appear and the layout will adjust to include room for the discussion.

# Report Tables

The **Report table** is the list view inside a report. It works like a built-in spreadsheet for all expenses on that report.

## Table structure and fields
Each row represents an expense and includes:
- Merchant name
- Date
- Amount
- Category
- Description

## Available Actions on the Table
- **Click an expense** to view or edit it in the right-hand panel  
- **Select multiple expenses** using checkboxes, then apply bulk actions like:
  - Move to another report: When you need to have two reports or break across multiple months
  - Download: For exporting to a CSV file for analysis or to share with your accountant
  - Hold: To keep the expenses of someone you are approving, back until they are complete
  - Delete: To remove your own expenses from the workflow

**Note:** The bulk action menu appears after selecting at least one expense.

## Steps to Move Expenses Between Reports

1. Select the expenses using checkboxes  
2. Click **Move expense(s)** from the bulk action menu  
3. In the right-hand panel, select a destination draft report  
4. Expenses are moved, and a system message logs the action

## Add a New Expense to the Table
- The expense appears in the table  
- Its row is briefly highlighted as new  
- Once added, the **Submit** button appears in the header (replacing **Add expense**, which moves to the **More** menu)

# Filters

Filters help you quickly find specific expenses or reports—especially helpful for large datasets.

## Filter Placement

- **Add unreported expenses**: Use filters to find expenses to add to a report  
- **Reports page search**: Filter by workspace, submitter, or status

## Filter Controls

1. Use filters to show a specific set of expenses (e.g. unreported expenses)  
2. Use controls to sort expenses by:
   - Date Range
   - Category
   - Merchant
   - Workspace
   - Tags (if enabled)
   - Status (e.g. pending, reimbursed)

**Filter controls may appear as:**
- Dropdowns  
- Chips  
- Search bars  
- Radio buttons or checkboxes

**Once filters are applied:**
- The list updates in real-time  
- **Select all** only applies to filtered results

## Default Filter Behavior
- Without filters, you'll see your **most recent unreported expenses**  
- Combine **search + filter** to narrow results (e.g. “Uber in March”)

# Smart Suggestions

Smart suggestions recommend the next best action—like submitting a report or adding unreported expenses—based on your activity.

## Smart Suggestion Locations

- **SelfDM** (your personal chat with Concierge): Suggests unreported expenses to add to a report  
- **Empty draft reports**: Prompts you to add recent unreported expenses  
- **Global create and quick actions**: Suggests “Create report” if you frequently submit grouped expenses

**When Smart Suggestions come in handy:** If you create a draft report and have unreported expenses in your SelfDM, a prompt may appear to add those expenses quickly.

**Benefits of Smart Suggestions:**
- Reduce manual effort  
- Encourage on-time reporting  
- Help new members take the right actions
