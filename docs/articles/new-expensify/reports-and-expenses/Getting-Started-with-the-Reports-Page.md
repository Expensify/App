# Report Previews

Report previews are summaries shown directly in your workspace chat in the **Inbox**. They let you check a report’s status without opening it.

## Visibility of Report Previews
- Visible to **all members** in the workspace chat  
- Only the **creator** sees interactive options like **Add expense**  
- **Workspace admins** can approve and pay a report

## Preview Details
- Report title and status (e.g., Approved, Paid)  
- Up to 10 expense previews with:
  - Date, category, tag
  - Merchant or description
  - Receipt thumbnail  
- Carousel navigation  
- **+X more** link if there are over 10 expenses  
- Action button: Submit, Approve, Pay, etc., depending on the role

## Preview Behavior and Updates
Previews update **in real time** as expenses are added. If a report is deleted, the preview is removed from the workspace chat

**When someone comments on a report:**
- A **Comments** section will appear, and the layout will adjust to include room for the discussion.

# Report Tables

The **Report table** is the list view inside a report. It works like a built-in spreadsheet for all expenses on that report.

## Table structure and fields
Each row represents an expense and includes:
- Merchant name
- Date
- Amount
- Category
- Description

## Available Actions on the Table
- **Click an expense** to view or edit it in the right-hand panel  
- **Select multiple expenses** using checkboxes, then apply bulk actions such as:
  - **Move to another report:** When you need to have multiple reports or need to break up expenses across multiple weeks or months.
  - **Download:** For exporting to a CSV file for analysis or to share with your accountant.
  - **Hold:** Use this when you need to temporarily pause the approval of an expense until all required information is provided.
  - **Delete:** To remove expenses from the expense report.

**Note:** The bulk action menu appears after selecting at least one expense.

## Steps to Move Expenses Between Reports

1. Select the expenses using checkboxes  
2. Click **Move expense(s)** from the bulk action menu  
3. In the right-hand panel, select a destination draft report  
4. Expenses are moved, and a system message logs the action

## Add a New Expense to the Table
- The expense appears in the table  
- Its row is briefly highlighted as new  
- Once added, the **Submit** button appears in the header (replacing **Add expense**, which moves to the **More** menu)

# How to Use Filters to Find Reports and Expenses
Filters help you narrow down expenses or reports so you can find exactly what you need—fast. This is especially useful when you're working with a large dataset or trying to take specific actions, such as reporting unsubmitted expenses.

**Filters can help you:**

- **Add unreported expenses to a report**: Use filters to find unreported expenses, and then add them to a report with just a few clicks.
- **Quickly search and locate specific reports using filters**  
  On the **Reports** page, filter by:
  - **Workspace**
  - **Submitter**
  - **Report status** (e.g., Open, Approved, Reimbursed)

### Available Filters in New Expensify

You can filter your **expenses** and **reports** using dropdowns, search bars, and chips. 

- **Expenses:** can be filtered by `Date`, `Merchant`, `Category`, `Tag`, `Amount`, `Reimbursable`, `Billable`, `Status` (e.g. Unreported)

- **Reports:** can be filtered by `Submitter`, `Workspace`, `Report Status` (e.g. Draft, Outstanding, Approved, Paid), `Date`

To view other available filters, click into the **search box** on the Reports or Expenses page.

## How Filtering Works

1. Apply filters to view only the results that match your criteria.
2. Once filters are applied:
   - The list updates in real time  
   - The **Select all** option applies *only* to the filtered results—not everything

You can also combine filters with keyword search for even more precision. For example, searching **"Uber in March"** will show only Uber rides from March.

**Note:** If you haven't applied any filters yet, you'll see your **most recent unreported expenses** by default.

# How to Use Smart Suggestions

Smart suggestions recommend the next best action—like submitting a report or adding unreported expenses—based on your activity.

## Smart Suggestion Locations

- **SelfDM** (your personal chat with Concierge): Suggests unreported expenses to add to a report  
- **Empty draft reports**: Prompts you to add recent unreported expenses  
- **Global create and quick actions**: Suggests “Create report” if you frequently submit grouped expenses

**When Smart Suggestions come in handy:** If you create a draft report and have unreported expenses in your SelfDM, a prompt may appear to add those expenses quickly.

**Benefits of Smart Suggestions:**
- Reduce manual effort  
- Encourage on-time reporting  
- Help new members take the right actions
