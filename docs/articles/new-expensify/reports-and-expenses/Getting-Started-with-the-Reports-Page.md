  - Report title and status (Approved, Paid, etc.)
  - Up to 10 expense previews (date, category, tag, merchant/description, receipt thumbnail)
  - **+X more** link if there are over 10 expenses
  - Action button (Submit, Approve, Pay, etc.) depending on your role

## Preview behavior
  - Updates in **real time** as expenses are added.
  - If a report is deleted, the preview is removed.

# Filters

Filters help you narrow down expenses or reports so you can find exactly what you need, fast. This is especially useful when you're working with a large dataset or trying to take specific actions, such as reporting unsubmitted expenses.

  - Apply filters to see only matching results.
  - The list updates in real time.
  - Select all applies only to filtered results.
  - Combine filters with keyword search (e.g., “Uber in March”).

**Note**: If no filters are applied, the page defaults to showing your most recent unreported expenses.

## Filter Controls

You’ll find different controls depending on where you are in your account. These may appear as:

  - Dropdowns
  - Search bars
  - Chips (selectable tags)
  - Radio buttons or checkboxes

## Common Filters

  - Date range
  - Category
  - Merchant
  - Workspace
  - Tags (if enabled)
  - Status (e.g., pending, reimbursed)
