Get familiar with the Reports page in New Expensify. This guide walks you through using report previews, tables, filters, and smart suggestions to streamline your expense-tracking workflow.

The **Reports page** shows a full list of your reports and related expenses. While the Inbox highlights what needs attention, this page helps you explore, filter, and export your expense data.

# Report Previews

Report previews are summaries shown directly in your workspace chat in the **Inbox**. They let you check a report’s status without opening it.

## Visibility of Report Previews
- Visible to **all members** in the workspace chat  
- Only the **creator** sees interactive options like **Add expense**  
- **Workspace admins** can approve and pay a report

## Preview Details
- Report title and status (e.g., Approved, Paid)  
- Up to 10 expense previews with:
  - Date, category, tag
  - Merchant or description
  - Receipt thumbnail  
- Carousel navigation  
- **+X more** link if there are over 10 expenses  
- Action button: Submit, Approve, Pay, etc., depending on the role

## Preview Behavior and Updates
Previews update **in real time** as expenses are added. If a report is deleted, the preview is removed from the workspace chat

**When someone comments on a report:**
- A **Comments** section will appear, and the layout will adjust to include room for the discussion.

# Report Tables

The **Report table** is the list view inside a report. It works like a built-in spreadsheet for all expenses on that report.

## Table structure and fields
Each row represents an expense and includes:
- Merchant name
- Date
- Amount
- Category
- Description

## Available Actions on the Table
- **Click an expense** to view or edit it in the right-hand panel  
- **Select multiple expenses** using checkboxes, then apply bulk actions such as:
  - **Move to another report:** When you need to have multiple reports or need to break up expenses across multiple weeks or months.
  - **Download:** For exporting to a CSV file for analysis or to share with your accountant.
  - **Hold:** Use this when you need to temporarily pause the approval of an expense until all required information is provided.
  - **Delete:** To remove expenses from the expense report.

**Note:** The bulk action menu appears after selecting at least one expense.

## Steps to Move Expenses Between Reports

1. Select the expenses using checkboxes  
2. Click **Move expense(s)** from the bulk action menu  
3. In the right-hand panel, select a destination draft report  
4. Expenses are moved, and a system message logs the action

## Add a New Expense to the Table
- The expense appears in the table  
- Its row is briefly highlighted as new  
- Once added, the **Submit** button appears in the header (replacing **Add expense**, which moves to the **More** menu)

# Filters
Filters help you narrow down expenses or reports so you can find exactly what you need—fast. This is especially useful when you're working with a large dataset or trying to take specific actions, such as reporting unsubmitted expenses.

**Filters can help you:**

- **Add unreported expenses to a report**: Use filters to find unreported expenses, and then add them to a report with just a few clicks.
- **Quickly search reports**  
  On the **Reports** page, filter by:
  - **Workspace**
  - **Submitter**
  - **Report status** (e.g., Open, Approved, Reimbursed)

## Filter Controls

You’ll find different controls depending on where you are in your account. These may appear as:
- Dropdowns  
- Search bars  
- Chips (selectable tags)  
- Radio buttons or checkboxes  

Common filters include:
- **Date range**
- **Category**
- **Merchant**
- **Workspace**
- **Tags** (if enabled)
- **Status** (e.g., pending, reimbursed)

## How Filtering Works

1. Apply filters to view only the results that match your criteria.
2. Once filters are applied:
   - The list updates in real time  
   - The **Select all** option applies *only* to the filtered results—not everything

You can also combine filters with keyword search for even more precision. For example, searching **"Uber in March"** will show only Uber rides from March.

**Note:** If you haven't applied any filters yet, you'll see your **most recent unreported expenses** by default.

# Smart Suggestions

Smart suggestions recommend the next best action—like submitting a report or adding unreported expenses—based on your activity.

## Smart Suggestion Locations

- **SelfDM** (your personal chat with Concierge): Suggests unreported expenses to add to a report  
- **Empty draft reports**: Prompts you to add recent unreported expenses  
- **Global create and quick actions**: Suggests “Create report” if you frequently submit grouped expenses

**When Smart Suggestions come in handy:** If you create a draft report and have unreported expenses in your SelfDM, a prompt may appear to add those expenses quickly.

**Benefits of Smart Suggestions:**
- Reduce manual effort  
- Encourage on-time reporting  
- Help new members take the right actions
