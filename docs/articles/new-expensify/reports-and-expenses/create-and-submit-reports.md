# Create a Report

Follow these steps to build and submit an expense report manually.

## Step 1: Create an empty report

1. Tap the green **➕ Create** button at the bottom of your screen.
2. Select **Create report**.
3. Choose the workspace for your report:
   - If you're in one workspace, it will be selected automatically.
   - If you're in multiple, you’ll be prompted to choose one.
4. A draft report will open with the workspace’s default title.

**Note:** The report will display *“This report is empty”* until expenses are added.

## Step 2: Add expenses to the report

Inside the draft report, tap **Add expense** to include expense items.

**Option A:** Create a new expense:

1. Tap **Add expense** > **Create new expense**.
2. Enter the expense details (amount, merchant, category).
3. The expense is added directly to the report.

**Option B:** Add existing unreported expenses:

1. Tap **Add expense** > **Add unreported expenses**.
2. Select the expenses you want to include.
3. Tap **Add to report**.

## Step 3: Submit the report

1. Once the report includes at least one expense, the **Submit** button will appear.
2. Tap **Submit**.
3. A confirmation message will appear after submission.

**Note:** If your workspace uses **instant submit**, your report may auto-submit once a valid expense is added.

# Fix and Retract Submitted Reports

Submitted a report too early? Need to add or remove an expense? You can **retract** submitted reports using the **Undo Submit** or **Undo Close** actions.

**Retract** means returning a report from **closed** or **processing** back to the **open** state so you can edit it.

- **Undo submit**: The retract button for **processing reports**
- **Undo close**: The retract button for **closed reports**
