# Search on the Reports Page

**Navigation: In the navigation tabs (on the left on web, and at the bottom on mobile), select Reports > Expense Reports > To-do**.

The **To-do** section surfaces key report actions so you can:
- Submit expenses waiting on you
- Approve reports that need your review
- Pay approved reports ready for reimbursement
- Export finalized reports to accounting platforms

These shortcuts are personalized based on your role and workspace configuration, helping you process reports in batches without manually building advanced searches.

- **Pay** – Reports ready for reimbursement.
- **Export** – Reports ready for accounting export (e.g., to QuickBooks).
