Using the search function on the reports page helps you quickly take action on reports you need to submit, approve, or pay, all tailored to your role in a workspace.

# Search on the Reports Page

**Navigation: In the left-hand menu, select Reports > Expense Reports > To-do**.

The **To-do** section surfaces key report actions so you can:
- Submit expenses waiting on you
- Approve reports that need your review
- Pay approved reports ready for reimbursement

These shortcuts are personalized based on your role and workspace configuration, helping you process reports in batches without manually building advanced searches.

# How to Use Search Shortcuts

Search options appear under the **To-do** section in the left-hand menu.

Depending on your role, you’ll see shortcuts like:
- **Submit** – Reports you’ve drafted and need to submit.
- **Approve** – Reports awaiting your review.
- **Pay** – Reports ready for reimbursement.

# FAQ

## What if I don't see the Submit, Approve, or Pay options?

These search shortcuts only appear when:
- You have reports that require those actions.
- You have the correct workspace permissions (e.g., Admin, Approver).

## Can I use these searches across multiple workspaces?

Not yet. The **Workspace filter** is currently single-select. Multi-workspace support is planned for a future update.

## What is the difference between Explore and To-do?

- **Explore** = General browsing (e.g., Expenses, Chats)
- **To-do** = Personalized actions based on your role (e.g., Submit, Approve, Pay)
