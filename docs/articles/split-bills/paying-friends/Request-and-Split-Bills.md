# How do these Payment Features work?
Our suite of money movement features enables you to request money owed by an individual or split a bill with a group.

**Request Money** lets your friends pay you back directly in Expensify. When you send a payment request to a friend, Expensify will display the amount owed and the option to pay the corresponding request in a chat between you.

**Split Bill** allows you to split payments between friends and ensures the person who settled the tab gets paid back.

These two features ensure you can live in the moment and settle up afterward.
