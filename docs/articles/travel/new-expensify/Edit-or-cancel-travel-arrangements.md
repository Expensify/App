You can review your travel arrangements any time by opening the Trip chat in your inbox. For example, if you booked a flight to San Francisco, a “Trip to San Francisco” chat will be automatically added to your chat inbox.  

To edit or cancel a travel arrangement,
1. Open your Inbox.  
2. Select the trip in the left hand panel. 
3. Select the leg of the travel you want to update, or click **View details**.
4. Click **Modify Trip**.
5. Select **Modify** or **Cancel**.
   
If there is an unexpected change to the itinerary (for example, a flight cancellation), Expensify’s travel partner **Spotnana** will reach out to the traveler to provide updates on those changes.

You can click **Get Support** on your emailed travel itinerary for real-time help with the booking. Any modifications, exchanges, or voidings made to a trip via support will incur a $25 booking change fee.
