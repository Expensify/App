# FAQ

**What happens if a traveler tries to book a restricted car type?**  
They won’t be able to complete the booking and will see an error or custom message depending on whether or not you're blocked out of policy bookings or allow them with explicit approval (hard approval).

**Can admins customize car booking rules by region or traveler group?**  
Not within the Car tab, but different travel policies can be assigned to specific departments, legal entities, or user groups to achieve that flexibility.

**Is there a way to enforce electric vehicle bookings for sustainability efforts?**  
Yes, admins can encourage sustainable travel by disallowing all engine types except electric under **Car engine types not allowed** setting.
