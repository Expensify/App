# FAQ

**Does the “cheapest rate” rule consider taxes and fees?**  
It depends on your configuration under the **Maximum price** setting — you can choose whether to include taxes and fees when evaluating the cheapest rate.

**Can we use reason codes to track exceptions?**  
Yes. Reason codes help you understand booking behaviors and justify policy exceptions for reporting or compliance purposes. When viewing policy violations in the **Analytics** > **Company reports** < **Compliance** section, you can see data on reason usage as well.
