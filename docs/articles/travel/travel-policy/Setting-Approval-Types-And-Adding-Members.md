### General tab settings

- **Parent Policy**: Select a parent policy to inherit approval and restriction settings.
- **Policy Name**: Choose a clear, easily identifiable name.
- **Approval Type** (for Air, Hotel, Car, Rail): Choose a separate approval action for in-policy and out-of-policy bookings.
  - **No action**: Bookings proceed with no approval.
  - **Passive approval**: No approval required, but the approver receives an email.
  - **Soft approval** (Recommended): Booking proceeds unless declined.
  - **Hard approval**: Booking is canceled unless explicitly approved.
- **Approver Type**:
  - **Manager Approval**: Uses the manager from the employee's Expensify workflow.
  - **Designated Approver**: Sends bookings to a pre-defined approver.
- **Default Approvers**: Add up to three backups to handle approval volume, especially when using Hard Approval.

### Edit Members tab

Admins assign those who are subject to the policy's booking rules. Add members by group:

- **Individual users** - Enter a specific user by name or email to the policy.
- **Departments** - Add all users with the same department in their travel profile. This could be helpful for a Sales team that needs different travel booking rules compared to another department.
- **Legal Entities** - Select an Expensify workspace to add all members of the workspace to the travel policy.
- **Offices** - Adds all users with the same office location in their travel profile.

You can add multiple groups to a travel policy and apply conditions to each group as needed.

Click the green **Create Policy** button at the bottom to save and activate the travel policy.

# FAQ

**Can I use the same travel policy across multiple teams?**  
Yes. Use groups like Departments or Offices to apply the same policy to multiple employee sets.

**Whatâ€™s the benefit of a parent policy?**  
We recommend configuring the system-provided **Default** policy with your baseline settings. Use this as a parent policy when creating new ones to speed up setup.

**What happens if no approvers are added to a Hard Approval policy?**  
Travel bookings will be automatically canceled if no approver is assigned.
