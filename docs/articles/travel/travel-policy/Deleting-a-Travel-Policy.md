    - A popup will appear warning that this action is **not reversible**.

# FAQ

**Can I recover a travel policy after deletion?**  
No. Deleting a policy is permanent and irreversible.

**What happens to travelers assigned to a deleted policy?**  
They will no longer be governed by the deleted policy and may not have a valid travel policy applied until reassigned.

**Can I delete the Default travel policy?**  
No. The Default travel policy cannot be deleted. Expensify recommends configuring the default policy as a template for future travel policies. Settings within the Air, Hotel, Car, and Rail tabs can be inherited from a parent policy, so setting the Default policy as a template saves time in the future.
