## Lowest logical fare

The settings described here offer travel admins the ability to control both how the lowest logical fare value is calculated for any given fare search and how in-policy ranges around that fare value are applied. It may take some time for you to find the lowest logical fare settings that work best for your company. 

Some possible suggestions when first using this feature are:

- Set the More than lowest logical fare field to a value that allows your travelers some flexibility to select the flight that is best for them. This setting is found under both the Dynamic Flight Budget – Domestic and Dynamic Flight Budget – International fields (under Budget).
- Set the No. of stops field to Fewest.
- Set the Airport connection changes field to Don’t allow.
- Consider setting the Carrier field to Exclude and selecting budget airlines to exclude from the lowest logical fare calculation.

Configure the following setting for more flexible control and traveler ease of use. 
- **Layover duration** (Domestic and International) - Set the maximum layover time (per stop) to be considered when generating the lowest logical fare. If the route a user selects has a minimum layover duration time higher than this setting, the shortest layover time will be used to generate the lowest logical fare value.
- **Number of stops** - Set the number of stops to be used when generating the lowest logical fare. Options include:
    - Any - Consider all flights regardless of the number of stops.
    - One stop or less – Consider all flights with one stop or less. If selected, and route selected by user only offers non-stop, lowest logical fare would use non-stop. If route selected by the user had one-stop options, lowest logical fare would use one-stop.
    - Two stops or less – Consider all flights with two stops or less. If selected, and route selected by user only offers non-stop, lowest logical fare would use non-stop. If route selected by the user had one-stop options, lowest logical fare would use one-stop. If route selected by the user had two-stop options, lowest logical fare would use two-stops.
    - Fewest – If selected, and route selected by user had non-stop and one-stop options, lowest logical fare would use non-stop. If route selected by the user had only one-stop and two-stop options, lowest logical fare would use one-stop.
- **Flight time window** (Domestic and International) - Set the number of hours before and after a flight's departure time to be used to generate the lowest logical fare value. For example, if you select +/- 2 hours, for a 10am flight, any departure between 8am-12pm would be considered.
- **Airport connection changes** - Set whether flights that require airport changes are to be included or excluded when generating the lowest logical fare value. An example of an airport change could be a connecting flight in New York City, NY that requires the traveler to arrive at JFK but depart from LGA. 
- **Carrier** inclusion/exclusion - Designates the carriers that should be included or excluded when generating the lowest logical fare value. Options include:
    - Any (allow all carriers)
    - Include – Search for and select the carriers to include when generating the lowest logical fare value.
     - Exclude – Search for and select the carriers to exclude when generating the lowest logical fare value.
- **Mixed cabin itineraries** - Allow the lowest logical fare to include fares containing mixed cabin classes (for flights with more than one leg). Only cabin classes at or below the maximum allowed by policy will be considered.

# FAQ

## What happens if a traveler books a restricted fare type?

Depending on the action you select in your settings, the booking will be flagged as out of policy or blocked.

## What’s the difference between a budget and the lowest logical fare?

Budgets set fixed or dynamic limits within a dollar or percentage threshold. The lowest logical fare (LLF) is even more dynamic and offers travelers extra flexibility. It uses search criteria like duration and stops to define a “logical” range.

## Can I allow upgrades only when certain conditions are met?

Yes. You can allow cabin upgrades if they’re cheaper than the in-policy fare or if an in-policy fare isn’t available.

## Are refundable or changeable fares always in policy?

Not necessarily. You must configure which types of refundable and changeable fares qualify as in-policy in the Refundable and Changeable ticket settings.

## What happens if a traveler exceeds the CO2 threshold?

The flight will be marked out of policy. Travelers can still book it if allowed, but the policy settings you configure will determine the approval action.
