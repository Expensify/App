Set up multiple travel policies to manage different booking rules, traveler types, and approval workflows across your company. Whether for employees or external guests, flexible policy configurations give you precise control over your travel program.

## How to access Expensify Travel

- **In New Expensify:** Click the green **+** button in the bottom-left corner of your screen, then select **Book travel**.
- **In Classic Expensify:** Click **Travel** in the left-hand menu, then select **Book or manage travel**.

Note: Only Travel Admins can create or manage travel policies in Expensify Travel.

**Need to enable travel still?** Reach out to your Account Manager or Concierge to schedule a travel demo and get it enabled for your account.

# Multi-policy configurations

Travel admins can create and manage multiple travel policies at no extra cost, allowing for distinct rules, member groups, and approval flows across departments or traveler types.

## Policy types supported

- **Employee policies:** Most common, used for internal staff to group different employees into different policies e.g department specific policies. 
- **Non-employee policies:** Ideal for external travelers, like job candidates or contractors. These can be linked to a *Candidate workspace* in Expensify for streamlined reimbursement via ACH.

## Use a default policy as a template

We recommend setting up your company’s **Default** travel policy as a baseline configuration. When creating new policies, you can inherit settings from this "parent" policy, reducing setup time and ensuring consistent enforcement of core rules.

Any inherited settings display with a link icon. To customize them independently, click the icon to break the inheritance.

## Assigning members to a policy

Admins can add members to each travel policy using flexible grouping options:

- **Individual users** – Add by email.
- **Departments** – Apply departments to traveler profiles and use them to group employees and bulk assign them to policies.
- **Legal entities** – Add all members of an Expensify workspace.
- **Offices** – Based on each traveler’s assigned location in their traveler profile.

## Use case examples

- **Executives** – May benefit from a policy with higher booking limits or premium travel options.
- **Sales teams** – Frequent travelers may have tailored approval and budget rules.
- **Contractors or interview candidates** – Managed under a non-employee policy for simplified billing and control.

To create a department for grouping users, go to **Program > Users > click traveler > General tab > Company settings > Department**.

# FAQs

**Can I copy rules from one policy to another?**  
Yes! When creating a new policy, you can inherit settings from an existing one. We recommend using your Default policy as a baseline.

**What’s the difference between a policy and a workspace?**  
A policy controls travel booking rules. A workspace is where your expense reports live. Multiple travel policies can exist within a single workspace or across several.

**How should I group users if I need different rules?**  
We recommend creating Departments based on roles, regions, or teams. Then assign each department to the appropriate travel policy.

**Can a non-employee book their own travel?**  
If the non-employee is a member of a workspace and they are added to a travel policy, then yes. However, if the employee does not have an Expensify account, they will not have a travel profile, and a travel arranger or admin must book on their behalf using the guest booking feature.
