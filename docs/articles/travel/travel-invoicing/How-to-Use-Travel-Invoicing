If your company uses Travel Invoicing in Expensify, you don’t need a corporate card to book travel. We’ll explain how to find your Travel CVV and what to expect at hotels or rental car counters.

# Finding Your Travel CVV

When booking a flight, hotel, or rental car in Expensify Travel (via Spotnana), you’ll be asked to enter a **CVV** — even though the card was never given to you directly. Here’s how to find it:

1. In the left-hand menu, select **Account > Wallet**.
2. Under **Assigned cards**, find the one labeled **Travel CVV**.
3. Tap it and select **Reveal CVV**.
4. Use the number displayed during the checkout process.

> You won’t see the full card number — just the CVV. That’s expected!

The card is **virtual-only** and can only be used within Expensify Travel, so it's safe and secure.

# What to Expect at Hotel Check-In

Some hotels or rental car companies may ask for proof that you’re authorized to use the virtual card. This is where the **Credit Card Authorization (CCA)** form comes in.

## What is a CCA?

A **Credit Card Authorization (CCA)** form tells the hotel or rental agency that:
- Your company is paying for the booking
- You’re allowed to use the virtual card
- The charge will be settled later via Expensify

## Do I need to do anything?

Nope! We handle it for you.

If your booking requires a CCA:
- Our team will reach out to the hotel or rental agency
- We’ll send the completed form on your behalf
- You may receive a confirmation message once it’s approved

In rare cases, the front desk might not see the authorization right away. If that happens:
- Politely let them know your company is covering the cost through a virtual card
- Ask if they’ve received a credit card authorization form from Expensify
- Contact your company admin or Concierge if there’s an issue

# FAQ

## I don’t see a CVV in my Wallet — what do I do?

Make sure:
- You’re logged into Expensify with your work email
- Your workspace has Travel Invoicing enabled
- You’ve been added to a travel-enabled workspace

If you're still not seeing it, reach out to your company admin.

## Can I use the Travel CVV outside of Expensify Travel?

No. The Travel card only works within Expensify Travel’s booking system (Spotnana). It won’t work on other travel sites or at physical locations.

## Will I see this travel expense in my Expensify account?

Nope! With Travel Invoicing, expenses are tracked by your company — so you don’t need to code or submit anything. Just book, travel, and go.
