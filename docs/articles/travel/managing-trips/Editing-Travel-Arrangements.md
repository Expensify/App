## How to edit your travel booking

1. Go to **Trips** > **My Trips** and click on the trip you'd like to update.
2. In the **Trip view**, find the booking you want to edit (flight, hotel, car, or rail).
3. Click the green **Modify** button.
4. Select the booking you want to modify.
5. Make allowed changes, then follow the prompts to confirm the changes.

Depending on the provider, available edits may include:
- Changing flight times or seats
- Updating hotel check-in or check-out dates
- Modifying car pickup or drop-off times
- Adjusting passenger or loyalty details

If a change cannot be made in product, you’ll be directed to contact support.

## What to know about editing bookings

- **There is no fee to make changes yourself** in Expensify.
- If you need help from support, a **$25 fee per trip** applies.
- Any change made by support still counts as part of the same trip and does not trigger a new trip fee.
- If you cancel and re-book a different flight within the **same trip**, you won’t be charged another booking fee.

---

## Can I make edits directly through the provider?

Yes. For example, you can:
- Make flight changes directly through the airline
- Use hotel or car rental websites to update your booking

However, these external changes may not sync back into your Expensify trip, and receipts will not automatically merge unless booked or modified in Expensify.
