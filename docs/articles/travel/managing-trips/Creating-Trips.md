## What is a trip?

A trip in Expensify groups together all related bookings for the same journey under one umbrella. For example, a round-trip flight, hotel stay, and rental car in the same city can all be part of a single trip.

Each trip includes:
- A **trip ID**
- A **start and end date** (based on your round-trip flight)
- A **$15 trip fee**
- An **activity log**, booking details, and optional traveler notes

## How to create a trip during checkout

If you’re booking travel, you’ll be prompted to either:
- **Select an existing trip**, or
- **Create a new trip**

To create a trip during checkout:
1. Start any booking (flight, hotel, or car).
2. When you reach the **Select a trip** section of the checkout screen, click **Select a trip**.
3. Select an existing trip or **Create new trip**.
    - If you create a new trip, enter a trip name and optionally a trip description.
4. Click **Save** to create the trip and proceed with checkout.

The trip will be created automatically and will include this booking. You can add more travel to it later.

# FAQ

## Can I create multiple trips?
Yes. You can create and manage as many trips as needed, either during booking or in advance.

## Will I be charged multiple times for one trip?
No. There is a single $15 fee per trip, no matter how many bookings are added to it.

## Can I change the traveler for a trip?
When you create a trip, you can change who the trip is for. When you create a booking, the trip is tied to the person you're booking for. Once a trip is created, its traveler cannot be changed.
