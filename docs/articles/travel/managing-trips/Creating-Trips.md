## What is a trip?

A trip groups together all related bookings for the same journey in one bucket. For example, a round-trip flight, hotel stay, and rental car in the same city can all be part of a single trip.

Each trip includes:
- A **trip ID**
- An **activity log**, booking details, and optional traveler notes
- A **start and end date** (based on your round-trip flight)
- A **$15 trip fee** when booking or managing the trip yourself in Expensify Travel on web or mobile, OR,
- A **$25 trip fee** when travel agent support books or manages your trip on your behalf
    - Note: The travel agent support fee, if assessed after the $15 trip fee has been charged, will only result in an additional $10 charge, bringing the trip fee up to $25.

## How to create a trip during checkout

If you’re booking travel, you’ll be prompted to either:

To create a trip during checkout:
1. Start any booking (flight, hotel, or car).
2. When you reach the **Select a trip** section of the checkout screen, click **Select a trip**.
