## What is a trip?

A trip groups together all related bookings for the same journey in one bucket. For example, a round-trip flight, hotel stay, and rental car in the same city can all be part of a single trip.

Each trip includes:
- A **trip ID**
- A **start and end date** (based on your round-trip flight)
- A **$15 trip fee**
- An **activity log**, booking details, and optional traveler notes

## How to create a trip during checkout

If you’re booking travel, you’ll be prompted to either:
- **Select an existing trip**, or
- **Create a new trip**

To create a trip during checkout:
1. Start any booking (flight, hotel, or car).
2. When you reach the **Select a trip** section of the checkout screen, click **Select a trip**.
3. Select an existing trip or **Create new trip**.
    - If you create a new trip, enter a trip name and optionally a trip description.
4. Click **Save** to create the trip and proceed with checkout.

The trip will be created automatically and will include this booking. You can add more travel bookings to it later.
