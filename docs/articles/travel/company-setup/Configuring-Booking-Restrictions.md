# FAQ

## Can I apply restrictions to just one travel type?
Yes. For country/region restrictions, you can specify individual travel types like flights or hotels.

## Do restrictions apply to all users automatically?
No. You must explicitly assign users, countries, or legal entities to each restriction.

## Can employees see why their booking is restricted?
Yes. If a restriction applies, the reason set by the admin will appear during the booking process.
