## How to manage users

The list includes all travelers in your company’s active **legal entities** (Expensify workspaces). You can:

Clicking a traveler's name opens their full profile, which includes three editable tabs.

## Roles tab

Admins can assign one of the following roles:

- **Traveler** – Can view and book travel for themselves only
- **Travel arranger** – Can book for themselves and others
- **Company admin** – Has full access to company settings and booking privileges

## Configuration tab

**Book travel for guests**
- Toggle this setting on to let the user book for guests (non-Expensify travelers like candidates or an employee's family member.)

**Secondary approvers**
- Add one or more backup approvers who will receive notifications and can approve travel requests received by the user on their behalf.
    - This is helpful when using **hard approval** rules that require explicit approval of travel requests in the event the travel approver is out of the office.

**My arrangers**
- Assign travel arrangers who can book travel for this user
- Only users with the **Travel arranger** role will appear in the search list

Be sure to click **Save** after editing any tab to apply your changes.

# FAQ

## Can I import user data like departments or cost centers from my accounting software?
Not at this time. If this functionality would benefit your team, talk to your Account Manager to share feedback and explore alternatives.

## What happens if I don’t assign a legal entity?
Every user must be assigned to a legal entity (Expensify workspace) in order to use travel features. This field is required.

## Can users assign their own arrangers or secondary approvers?
Yes. Users can update their arrangers and secondary approvers in their own profile settings if permitted.
