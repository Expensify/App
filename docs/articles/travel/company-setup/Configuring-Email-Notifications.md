## Approver Settings

Under the **Approver Settings** tab of Email notifications, you’ll find two toggles that control default email behavior for travel approvers:

- **Default approval request notifications**  
  Enable or disable emails to approvers when a booking requires review.

- **Default approval updates notifications**  
  Enable or disable emails when a booking they reviewed is approved or denied.

These settings can help manage inbox volume or ensure backup approvers stay informed.

# FAQ

## Can I send notifications to shared email addresses or aliases?
Yes. You can use shared inboxes, email aliases, or distribution lists in the CC or BCC fields.

## Can I create multiple rules with different conditions?
Absolutely. Each rule can have different triggers and filters. You can create as many rules as needed.

## Do approvers still receive notifications if their settings are turned off?
No. If the toggle for approval notifications is disabled, those approvers won’t receive email alerts unless included in a separate notification rule.
