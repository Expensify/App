# FAQ

## Can I upload corporate rates myself?
No. Corporate rates must be uploaded into the GDS by the hotel and activated by Expensify.

## Who should I contact to start the process?
Reach out to your Account Manager or message Concierge. We’ll help you get started.

## How long does it take for rates to be available?
It depends on how quickly the hotel uploads the rate to the GDS. Once the hotel takes action, activation can be completed on Expensify's side in 2-3 business days.
