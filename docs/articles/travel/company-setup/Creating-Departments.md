# FAQ

## Can regular employees create or manage departments?
No. Only users with the Travel Admin role can view or manage department settings.

## Can users be in more than one department?
Each user can only be assigned to one department at a time.

## What happens if an employee changes departments?
Update their assignment under **Program** > **Users** to reflect their new department. Their policy assignment will update automatically if based on group rules.

Not at this time. If this functionality would benefit your team, talk to your Account Manager to share feedback and explore alternatives.
