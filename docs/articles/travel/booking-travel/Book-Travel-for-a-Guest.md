# FAQ

## Does the guest need to have an Expensify account?
No. Guest travelers don’t need an account to receive or use their travel reservation.

## Will the guest travel booking show up in my reports?
Yes. The booking appears in your Expensify account, and receipts are automatically added to an expense report.

Guest travel follows the same approval workflow as the member who made the booking. If your company requires approval for flights, hotels, or other travel types, those steps will still apply.
