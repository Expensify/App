# FAQ

## Who can book travel for other members?
Only members with the **Travel Arranger** role assigned by a Travel Admin can arrange travel for others.

## Will I be charged or the traveler?
The traveler's account is responsible for the charge. Receipts will route directly to them.

## Can I manage trips I’ve booked for someone else?
Yes. If you booked the trip on behalf of someone else, you can view and manage it from the Trips > My trips page. Click the **Pencil** icon to the right of your name in the traveler selection button and search for the traveler to pull up their trips.
