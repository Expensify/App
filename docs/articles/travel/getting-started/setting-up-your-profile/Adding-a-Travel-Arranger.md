## Why assign a travel arranger?

Travel arrangers are team members who can book travel for others. Adding one (or several) to your profile is helpful if someone regularly handles your bookings, such as an executive assistant or office manager.

Only users with the **Travel Arranger** role can be assigned as an arranger.

# FAQ

## Can I have more than one travel arranger?
Yes! You can assign multiple arrangers—everyone listed will be able to book travel for you.

## Why don't I see someone in the search results?
They must be assigned the **Travel Arranger** role by a Domain Admin before they’ll appear as an option.

## Can arrangers see or approve my bookings?
Travel arrangers can book on your behalf, but they don’t approve trips or access your personal bookings unless they created them.
