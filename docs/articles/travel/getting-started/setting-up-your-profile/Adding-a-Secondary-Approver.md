## Why add a secondary approver?

If you’re someone who approves travel for others, adding a backup approver ensures travel requests don’t stall when you’re out of office. If you're unavailable during the 24-hour post-booking review period, any assigned secondary approver can step in to approve or deny the request.

Note: This setting only applies to members responsible for approving travel. If you don’t approve travel for others, you can skip this step.

## How to add a secondary approver

1. Click your **user icon** in the top-right corner of the travel portal.
2. Select **My Profile**.
3. Go to the **Configuration** tab.
4. Click the **Add approver** button.
5. Search by name or email to find a member of your travel program.
6. Select the person you’d like to assign.
7. Repeat as needed to add multiple backup approvers.

Each person you add will receive approval notifications whenever a booking requires your review.

Note: A travel admin can also assign a secondary approver on your behalf.

# FAQ

## Can I add more than one secondary approver?
Yes. You can add as many as needed—each one will receive approval requests when you’re unavailable.

## Will my secondary approver get notified every time?
They’ll be notified only when a booking needs your approval. If you're inactive during the 24-hour review period, they can step in to approve or deny.

## Can I remove or change a secondary approver later?
Absolutely. Just return to the **Configuration** tab in your profile and make any necessary changes.
