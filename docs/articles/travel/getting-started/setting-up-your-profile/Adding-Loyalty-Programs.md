## Why add loyalty programs?

Adding loyalty programs to your profile means you won’t have to manually enter your information each time you book. Rewards and miles will apply automatically at checkout or after your flight has occurred, saving time and ensuring you get credit for each trip.

You can add as many loyalty programs as you're enrolled in.

**Important:** Loyalty benefits will only apply if the name and gender in your travel profile match the name and gender on your loyalty accounts.

Yes. You can store as many loyalty programs as you'd like across air, hotel, car, and rail.
