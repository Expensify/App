## How assisted trip fees work

You can always ask questions for free. You’ll only be charged a fee if a travel agent books or changes a trip for you.

Here’s a breakdown of the fees:

- **Self-serve trip** (booked or changed on your own): $15  
- **Assisted trip** (booked or changed by a travel agent): $25  
- **Already paid $15 but need agent help?** You’ll only be charged the additional $10 difference.

Once you’ve paid the $25 assisted trip fee, you can continue to get help with that trip as often as needed — no extra charges.

**Note:** The assisted trip fee only applies once per trip, no matter how many changes are made by the agent.
