## How travel bookings become expenses in Expensify

**1. Book your trip**
- Go to the `Travel` tab in Expensify.
- Search for flights, hotels, or car rentals.
- Confirm your booking just like you would on any travel site.

Once booked, everything else is automated.

**2. Booking data is imported**
- Details like flight numbers, hotel names, and prices are imported into Expensify.
- A receipt is automatically generated based on your booking.

**3. Expenses are auto-created**
- A separate expense is created for each trip item (e.g., flight, hotel) and any add-ons (e.g., seat fees).
- Each expense shows the correct amount and currency.
- Receipts are matched to card expenses and added to the right report.
- A report is created for the trip or the expense is added to an open report.

**4. Workspace policy and accounting sync**
- Expenses follow your workspace’s rules for categories, tags, and GL codes.
- If you’ve connected an accounting tool like **QuickBooks** or **NetSuite**, expenses sync automatically after approval or reimbursement.

## What you don’t need to do

Since Expensify Travel is fully integrated with Expensify, you can skip:
- Forwarding booking emails to `receipts@expensify.com`
- Manually creating travel expenses
- Uploading or attaching receipts
- Setting up an external travel policy

Expensify handles all of this in the background.
