# FAQ

## What if the attendee doesn’t have an Expensify account?  
You can still book travel for them using their email address. Even without an Expensify account, they’ll receive their itinerary via email.  

## How does payment work with central billing?  
If central billing is enabled, the company card will automatically be applied at checkout. If it’s not enabled, you’ll need to enter a payment method during booking.  

## Can I edit or cancel a booking made for an attendee?  
Yes. From **Trips > All Trips**, open the attendee’s trip and manage the booking details. Any changes or cancellations will be emailed to the attendee automatically.  

## Can I remove an attendee from an event?  
Yes. Select **Events**, open the event, select the attendee’s checkbox, and click **Delete**. The attendee will be notified of changes or cancellations automatically.  

## What happens if I enter the wrong traveler details?  
Traveler names must match their legal ID. If you entered incorrect information, you’ll need to cancel and rebook with the correct details.
