## What is an event?

An **event** is a coordinated trip created by a Travel Admin for multiple members traveling to the same destination.  

Each event includes:  
- Event name and description  
- $15 trip fee per traveler  
- Event dates and travel window (optional early arrival or late departure)  
- Supported travel types (flights, hotels, trains, cars)  
- Attendee list  
- Activity log, booking details, and optional traveler notes  

Admins can pay for all bookings at once using a central card.

## How to create an event

## Step 1: Create a trip template

1. Click on Travel from your Expensify account
2. When in the **Travel dashboard**, click **Program > Company > Expand > Configuration > Trip Template**.
3. Select **Create new**.
4. Configure the template settings:  
**Invitation settings**  
- **Invite**: Attendees get an email and book for themselves.  
- **No invite**: Admins book on behalf of attendees. *(This cannot be changed later and guests won't get an email invite.)*  

**Basic details**  
- **Template name**: Event name.  
- **Location**: Trip destination.  
- **Traveler type**: Allow policy members, guests, or both. *(Guests cannot self-book when “No invite” is selected.)*  
- **Policy**: Choose the policy connected to the event.  

**Booking rules**  
- **Apply member’s policy if less restrictive** (for example, if event rules allow economy but the member’s policy allows first class, they can book first class).  
- **Allowed booking types**: Define rules for flights, hotels, trains, and cars (methods, payment, restrictions).  

**Traveler details**  
- Traveler details are automatically filled from the profile. *(Allow overrides only if needed.)*  

**Other settings**  
- **Additional contacts**: CC or BCC coordinators on event communications.  
- **Default description**: Displayed to attendees.  
- **Notes to coordinator**: Private notes for admins.  

4. Select **Save** to finish.

## How to invite attendees

Policy Admins and arrangers can invite attendees to an event:  

1. Select **Traveler**.  
2. Search by email or invite a guest.  

**Notes:**  
- Members see the trip in **My Trips**.  
- Admins see all events in **Events**.  
- With **No invite**, attendees do not receive an email. To invite later, update the template to **Invite** and create a new event.  
- Invitations are finalized when the **Publish trips** button appears.

## How to view group bookings

Select **Trips > Events > [Event name]**.  

Here you can:  
- View the event description and attendees

From the **Event** page, select **Modify** to:  
- Update event details (location, dates, advanced settings)
