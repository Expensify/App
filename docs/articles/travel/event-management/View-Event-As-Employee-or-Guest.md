# FAQ

## What if I can’t find my event on the Trips page?

Confirm with your event organizer that you were added to the guest list. Employees should also make sure they’re signed in with their company email address.

## Can I view event details without an Expensify account?

Yes. Guests can use their event invitation email to view event details, even without an Expensify account.

## How do I know if my travel has been booked?

The **Trips** page shows the status of each travel type (flight, hotel, car, rail). If the status says **Booked**, your reservation is confirmed.

## Can I change or cancel my travel from the Trips page?

Yes. Open the trip details and follow the prompts to change or cancel. Keep in mind that change and cancellation policies depend on the airline, hotel, or rental provider.

## What should I do if I didn’t receive an invitation email?

Check your spam or junk folder first. If you still can’t find it, contact your event organizer or company administrator to confirm your email was added correctly.

## How can an attendee view their itinerary on mobile?

When a trip is booked through Expensify Travel, an itinerary is automatically created in New Expensify.

To view it:

1. Open the Expensify mobile app.  
2. Tap **Inbox**.  
3. Look for the thread named after your upcoming trip.
