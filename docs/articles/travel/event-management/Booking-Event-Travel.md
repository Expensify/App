# FAQ

## What if I don’t see the event in my Trips page?  
Confirm with your event organizer that you’ve been invited. Employees should also check that they’re logged in with their company email address.  

## Can someone else book my travel for me?  
Yes. Event organizers or designated travel arrangers can book on your behalf.  

## How do I know if a central billing card is available?  
If one is provided, you’ll see it listed under **Payment method** during checkout. Otherwise, use your own payment method.  

## What if I need to change or cancel my booking?  
Go to your **My Trips** page, select the event trip, and manage the booking there. Change and cancellation options vary by airline, hotel, or rental provider.  

## Can I book outside the event dates?  
Yes, but organizers may only cover costs during official event dates. Check with your organizer before extending your trip.
