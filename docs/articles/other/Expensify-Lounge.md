# What is the Expensify Lounge? 
The Expensify Lounge is a place for people to get shit done in a beautiful environment with great coffee and people to collaborate with. Please use this guide to learn how to utilize the Expensify Lounge best.

# The Two Rules
*Number One - Get Shit Done* 
The lounge is a space for people to get work done. It is optimized to be the perfect environment for you to focus on your work and collaborate with others to advance your ideas. We provide this by asking our members to keep in mind:

- **#focus** - Use the space for how it was designed, and do not distract from others' focus. It is beautiful, social, and collaborative, but it is built for work. 
- **#urgency** - Working remotely is great but often introduces delay.  Use the lounge to meet with whoever you need when time is of the essence. 
- **#results** - Don't mistake time for effort or effort for output. Upon arrival, visualize what you want to accomplish, and don't leave until it's done.

*Number Two - Don’t Ruin it for Everyone Else*
We want this place to be incredible for everyone and to get always be getting better. We don’t want too many rules, but we do need some guardrails. The following guiding principles allow us to do that: 
- **#writeitdown** - If you can help others learn from you, do so. Write a blog post, a document, or a post in Expensify Chat to share with others so they can learn from you. This includes making the Expensify Lounge a better space. Feel free to write down any improvements so we can continue to get better. 
- **#showup** - If you are in the lounge, be fully present. Meet others, and collaborate in social rooms. The point is to build a community of people getting shit done; you’ll get out what you put in.
- **#oneteam** - We provide an inclusive community for all. Do not discriminate against others, and aim to go out of your way to include people that want to be included. 
- **#nocreeps** - Do not make people feel uncomfortable with your words or actions. If you are made to feel uncomfortable or think others are, use this escalation process. 

# How to Use the Expensify Lounge
Below is a guide on how to help our members get the most out of the lounge centered around the rules above. 

Rule #1 - Getting Shit done: 
- **Order drinks from Concierge** - [Write Concierge here](https://new.expensify.com/concierge) to ask lounge questions or order beverages. Concierge will bring it to you where you are sitting! 
- **Using an office** - Offices are first come, first serve so go into any open one. Please keep office use to an hour or less. We do not allow any reservations at the moment. 
- **Lounge hours** - The lounge will be open from 8am-6pm PT, Monday through Friday and closed on some major holidays. Go to our google maps profile to see our opening for specific holidays.

Rule #2 - Not Ruining it for Everyone Else 
- **Offices are for calls** - Please do not occupy an office unless you have a call or collaborative meeting happening. Please do not stay in the offices longer than an hour. 
- **Respect other people** - Please do not be too loud or distracting from others trying to work. While in chat spaces, be respectful of others’ viewpoints and keep a positive environment. 
- **Stay home if you’re sick** - If you feel sick, please consider not visiting the lounge, or consider wearing a mask in public areas.
- **If you see something, say something** - If you are made to feel uncomfortable or witness others being made uncomfortable, let Concierge know. If this is happening in Chat, use our moderation tools (outlined below in the FAQ) to apply the applicable level of moderation, which includes flagging our team to take action.

# FAQs
- What is Concierge? 
    - Concierge is our automated system that answers members with questions in real-time. Concierge has also been built with Expensify Lounges in mind, where questions regarding the local lounge get routed directly to Concierge IRL, who welcomes you into the lounge. Write Concierge for any drink requests or questions, and they’ll take care of everything for you. 
- Who is invited to the Expensify Lounge? 
    - Everyone is invited to the Expensify Lounge! Whether you're an existing customer, or are just looking for a great space to get shit done, we'd love to have you.
- How do I escalate bad behavior? 
    - If you think something needs to be escalated from a chat space, use our escalation feature in chat to denote a chat as: 
        - “Spam” or “Inconsiderate” - this will send a whisper to the sender of the message warning them of the violation, and the message will have a flag applied to it which will be visible to all users. Concierge will not review these flags.
        - “Intimidating” or “Bullying” - The message will be immediately hidden, and the content will be reviewed by our team. Users will be able to click to reveal the hidden message. After review and if verified to be one of the above, the message will be permanently hidden, and a message will be sent to the sender of the message, warning them of the violation. 
        - “Harassment” or “Assault” - The message will be immediately hidden and reviewed by our team. The user will be sent a message to warning them of the violation. Users will not be able to view the removed message. If not, the message will be visible again as usual. Concierge will also be able to block the user if they determine it necessary.
    - If you witness something IRL, please write to Concierge referencing which lounge you are in, and they will escalate it appropriately.  
- Where are other Expensify Lounge locations?
    - Right now, we only have the San Francisco Lounge, but be on the lookout for more coming soon!
