# What is an account manager?
An account manager is a dedicated point of contact to support customers with questions about their Expensify account. They will actively monitor open technical issues and be proactive with recommendations to increase efficiency and minimize time spent on expense management.

Unlike Concierge, an account manager’s support will not be real-time, 24 hours a day.  A benefit of Concierge is that you get real-time support every day. Your account manager will be super responsive when online, but anything sent when they’re offline will not be responded to until they’re online again.

For real-time responses and simple troubleshooting issues, you can always message our general support by writing to Concierge via the in-product chat or by emailing concierge@expensify.com.

# How do I know if I have an account manager?
If you are a policy or domain admin, you will hear from your account manager as soon as one gets assigned to your company. You’ll also have the option to contact them when you log in to your account and click the Concierge icon.

## How do I contact my account manager?
You can contact your account manager by:
- Logging in to your Expensify account, opening Concierge, and clicking the “Chat with your  account manager” button;
-  Replying to or clicking the chat link on any email you get from your account manager;
- Signing in to new.expensify.com and searching for your account manager (this is still in a test phase, so it might not work for every customer).

# FAQs
## How can I request an account manager?
Not every customer will automatically be assigned an account manager. If you think you would benefit from having a dedicated account manager, please email a request to concierge@expensify.com, and we’ll do our best to assign one as soon as possible.

## How do I know if my account manager is online?
You will be able to see if they are online via their status, which will either say something like “online” or have their working hours.

## What if I’m unable to reach my account manager?
If for some reason, you’re unable to reach your account manager, perhaps because they’re offline, then you can always reach out to Concierge for assistance. Your account manager will always get back to you when they’re online again.

## Can I get on a call with my account manager?
Of course! You can ask your account manager to schedule a call whenever you think one might be helpful. We usually find that the most effective calls are those that deal with general setup questions. For technical troubleshooting, we typically recommend chat as that allows your account manager time to look into the issue, test things on their end, and, if needed, consult the wider Expensify technical team. It also allows you to easily refer back to instructions and links.
