# What is a billing owner in Expensify?

The **billing owner** is the member financially responsible for a workspace. They are the only person who can:

- Add or update the payment method on file
- Request early cancellation of an annual plan
- Delete a paid workspace
- Transfer billing ownership to another Workspace Admin

If you're not the billing owner, you won't see options to manage subscription or billing.

You can confirm who the billing owner is by checking the **Billing owner** column in the **Workspaces** tab on web or mobile.

# How billing works in Expensify

Expensify uses workspace-level billing. Each **paid workspace** has its own:

- Billing owner
- Subscription plan (Collect, Control, Pay-per-use, or Annual)
- Payment method

Billing is based on either:
- **Unique members** (for Collect plans), or
- **Active members** (for Control plans — anyone who submits, approves, or reimburses)

**Note:** You'll continue to be billed as long as you own one or more paid workspaces — even if you're no longer actively using them.

---

# Where to manage subscription and billing settings

Depending on which version of Expensify you’re using, you’ll find billing controls in slightly different places:

- **New Expensify:**  
  - Navigate to **Account > Subscription** to manage all billing settings
- **Expensify Classic:**  
  - Navigate to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Subscription**

In both cases, only billing owners will see the full list of subscription controls.

---

# What happens when a workspace is deleted?

Deleting a workspace removes it from your account and stops its billing. However:
- Your personal account and expenses remain
- Workspace-level features (like company cards) are removed
- If you’re still billing owner of another paid workspace, your subscription continues

Once a workspace is deleted, it cannot be reopened.

---

# How to stop billing entirely

To fully stop charges from Expensify, you must do one of the following:

- **Delete all paid workspaces** under your billing ownership, or  
- **Transfer billing ownership** of each paid workspace to another Workspace Admin

If you’re on an annual plan, you may first need to request early cancellation.

---

# Transferring billing ownership

Billing ownership can only be claimed — it **cannot be assigned by someone else**.

To transfer billing:
- The new billing owner must be a Workspace Admin
- They can claim ownership from workspace settings and will begin billing on the 1st of the next month

**Note:** Ownership cannot transfer mid-cycle.

# Requesting early cancellation

Early cancellation lets you exit an annual subscription before your term ends. This option is:

- Only available to billing owners
- Subject to eligibility review
- Required before deleting your final paid workspace on an annual plan

# FAQ

## How do I know if I'm the billing owner?

Go to the **Workspaces** tab and check the **Billing owner** column for each workspace. If your name appears there, you have full subscription access.

---

## Why can't I cancel or delete my subscription?

You must be the billing owner to access those options. If you are a Workspace Admin, you can transfer billing ownership to yourself from the workspace settings.

---

## Does deleting my workspace stop billing?

Only if it's your **last** paid workspace. You’ll continue to be billed for any remaining paid workspaces you still own.

---

## Can someone else transfer billing ownership to me?

No. Billing ownership can only be claimed by the new owner. It cannot be assigned by someone else.

---

## Can I reopen a workspace I deleted?

No. Deleting a workspace is permanent. You’ll need to create a new one.
