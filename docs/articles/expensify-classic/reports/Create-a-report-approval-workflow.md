Set up an automated report approval workflow in Expensify Classic to streamline expense review. Depending on your workspace's needs, you can choose a simple or multi-level approach.

# Set an Approval Workflow

To configure how expense reports are approved in your workspace:

1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Workflows**
2. Under **Approval Mode**, choose one of the following options:
   - **Submit and Close**\
     Reports are automatically approved and closed after submission. Use this if approvals happen outside of Expensify or if the submitter is also the approver.
   - **Submit and Approve** *(default)*\
     All reports are routed to a single approver assigned by the Workspace Admin.
   - **Advanced Approval**\
     Create a more detailed workflow. You can:
     - Assign different [approvers](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/reports/Assign-report-approvers-to-specific-employees) to different employees.
     - Require a second approval for reports that exceed a [specific amount](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/reports/Require-review-for-over-limit-expenses).

You can further customize the approval process by setting up rules based on specific [categories or tags](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/reports/Report-Approvals#assign-tag-and-category-approvers).

# Enforce the Approval Workflow

To make sure employees follow the set workflow:

1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Workflows**.
2. Enable **Enforce Workflow** under the **Approval Mode** section.

When enabled:

- Employees must follow the configured workflow.
- Admins can still “take control” of reports if necessary.
