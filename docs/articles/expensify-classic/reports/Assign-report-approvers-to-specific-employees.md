{% include info.html %}
To assign different approvers for different employees, your workspace must use Advanced Approvals as the report approval workflow.
{% include end-info.html %}

Rather than having one approver for all members of the workspace, you can use the Advanced Approvals workflow to assign different report approvers to specific employees. 

To assign a report approver to a specific member of your workspace, 
1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Click the desired workspace name. 
3. Click the **Members** tab on the left. 
4. Click **Settings** next to the desired member. 
5. Click the “Approves to” dropdown and select the desired approver for the member’s reports.
6. Click **Save**. 

You can also set 
- Over-limit approval rules that require a secondary approver when a specific member’s report expenses exceed a set limit.
- Approvers for expenses under a specific tag or category.
