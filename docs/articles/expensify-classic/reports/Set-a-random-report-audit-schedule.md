Expensify automatically flags reports that contain inaccurate or non-compliant expenses for review. However, you can also choose to randomly audit a percentage of compliant reports.

To set a random audit schedule, 
1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Click the desired workspace name. 
3. Click the **Members** tab on the left. 
4. Scroll down to the Expense Approvals heading under the Approval Modes section.
5. In the “Randomly route reports for manual approval” field, enter the percentage of reports that you want to be randomly audited. The default is set at 5% (or 1 in 20 reports).
6. Click **Save**.
