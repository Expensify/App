# FAQ

## How are credits or refunds displayed on Expense Reports?
Credits appear as negative expenses (e.g., -$1.00). They offset the total report amount.

**For example:**
- A report with $400 and $500 reimbursable expenses shows a total of $900.
- A report with -$400 and $500 expenses results in a $100 total.

## What’s the difference between an expense, a receipt, and a report attachment?

- **Expense:** Created when you SmartScan or manually upload a receipt.
- **Receipt:** Image file automatically attached to an expense via SmartScan.
- **Report Attachment:** Additional documents (e.g., supporting documents) added via the paperclip icon in report comments.

## What’s the Difference Between Expense Reports, Bills, and Invoices?

- **Expense Report**: Submitted by an employee to their employer. This may include:
  - **Reimbursable expenses** (e.g., business travel paid for with personal funds).
  - **Non-reimbursable expenses** (e.g., a company card lunch expense).
- **Invoice**: A report a business or contractor sends to another business to charge for goods or services received. For example:
  - A contractor providing an hourly-rate service sends an invoice detailing services provided and their hourly rate.
  - Invoices are generally expected to be paid within a set timeframe (e.g., 30 days of receipt).
- **Bill**: A document used by businesses and contractors to request payment for goods or services.
  - For example, a restaurant, store, or hair salon provides bills, typically expected to be paid upon receipt.
