# Report Statuses

Every report passes through several statuses. Here’s what they mean:

- **Draft** – In progress, not yet submitted. If also labeled **Rejected**, open the report to review comments and revise.
- **Outstanding** – Submitted and awaiting approval.
- **Approved** – Fully approved but not reimbursed.
- **Paid** – Payment sent. **Withdrawing** or **Confirmed** may appear based on ACH status. 
- **Done** – Finalized and no longer editable.

**Note:** A report will only move to the **Done** status if it's submitted on an **Individual workspace** or a **Group workspace** using the **Submit & Close** approval workflow.

## Finalized state by workflow

- **Non-reimbursable** – Finalized at **Approved**.
- **Reimbursable** – Finalized at **Paid**.
- **Mixed** – Finalized at **Paid**, even if only some expenses are reimbursable.

---

## Reports Marked as Closed

A report is automatically marked as **Done** under these conditions:

- **Individual Workspace** – Reports are closed by default after submission.  
- **Group Workspace with Submit and Close Workflow** – Reports automatically close upon submission.
