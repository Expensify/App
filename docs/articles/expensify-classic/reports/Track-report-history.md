<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

All changes and comments that have been made on a report are tracked at the bottom of the report. 

1. Click the **Reports** tab. 
2. Open a report. 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the report to review the reportâ€™s history and comments. 

Additionally, an email notification is sent to the employee when impactful changes are made to the report. For example, if the reimbursable status of an expense is changed, if an expense is approved or denied, or if a comment is added to the report.
