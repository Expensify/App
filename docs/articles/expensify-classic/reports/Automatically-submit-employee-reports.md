By setting a submission schedule for your workspace, expenses are automatically added to a report and submitted for approval based on the schedule you choose. This ensures employee expenses are collected without requiring manual submission each time.

When an employee creates an expense, it's automatically added to a report. If no report exists, a new one is created. Expense reports are submitted at the cadence you select—daily, weekly, monthly, twice per month, or by trip.

**Note:** If you are using Delayed Submissions and an expense has a violation, it won’t be submitted until the issue is resolved. The expense is removed from the report and added to a new open report.

# Set an Expense Report Submission Schedule

1. Go to **Settings > Workspace > [Workspace Name] > Workflows**.
2. Click the **Delay Submissions** toggle to enable it.
3. Click **Submission frequency** and choose from:
   - **Daily** – Submitted every evening. Violations are submitted once corrected.
   - **Weekly** – Submitted once a week. Violations are submitted the following Sunday after correction.
   - **Twice a month** – Submitted on the 15th and the last day of the month. Violations are submitted at the next applicable date.
   - **Monthly** – Submitted once per month. You'll select which day. Violations are submitted the following month.
   - **By trip** – A report is submitted when no new expenses are added for two full days. A new trip report begins after that.
   - **Manually** – Expenses are auto-added to a report, but employees must submit manually. This helps organize expenses without submitting automatically.

# FAQ

## I turned off Delay Submissions. Why do I still get reports submitted by Concierge?

Turning off **Delay Submissions** for a Workspace doesn’t override an employee’s Individual Workspace settings. If reports are still submitted automatically, the employee likely has Delay Submissions enabled on their Individual Workspace.

## What time of day are reports submitted via Delay Submissions?

All automatic report submissions happen in the evening PST (Pacific Standard Time).

## What happens if Delay Submissions is used on both my Individual and Company Workspace?

The submission settings from the Company Workspace override those from the Individual Workspace.

## Does using Delay Submissions automatically create separate reports for each of my credit cards?

No, setting a submission schedule via **Delay Submissions** collects all expenses into a single report and submits them based on your selected frequency.

If you need reports organized by card:
- Create separate reports for each card and manually assign expenses.
- Use filters to group expenses by card and assign them to the correct report.
