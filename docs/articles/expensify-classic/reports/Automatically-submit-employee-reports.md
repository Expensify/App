title: Automatically Submit Employee Reports
description: Use Expensify's Scheduled Submit feature to have your employees' expenses submitted automatically.
---

Scheduled Submit automatically adds expenses to a report and sends them for approval so that your employees do not have to remember to manually submit their reports each week. This allows you to automatically collect employee expenses on a schedule of your choosing.

With Scheduled Submit, an employee's expenses are automatically gathered onto a report as soon as they are created. If there is no existing report, a new one is created. The report is then automatically submitted at the cadence you choose—daily, weekly, monthly, twice per month, or by trip.

**Note:** If an expense has a violation, **Scheduled Submit** will not automatically submit it until the violations are corrected. In the meantime, the expense will be removed from the report and added to an open report.

#  Scheduled Submit

1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces**.
2. Click the **Group** tab on the left (or click the **Individual** tab to enable Scheduled Submit for your Individual Workspace).  
3. Click the desired Workspace name.
4. Click the **Reports** tab on the left.
5. Click the **Scheduled Submit** toggle to enable it.
6. Click the **How often expenses submit** dropdown and select the submission schedule:
   - **Daily**: Expenses are submitted every evening. Expenses with violations are submitted once the violations are corrected.
   - **Weekly**: Expenses are submitted once a week. Expenses with violations are submitted the following Sunday after the violations are corrected.
   - **Twice a month**: Expenses are submitted on the 15th and the last day of each month. Expenses with violations are submitted at the next cycle (either on the 15th or the last day of the month, whichever is closest).
   - **Monthly**: Expenses are submitted once per month. If you select Monthly, you will also select which day of the month the reports will be submitted. Expenses with violations are submitted on the next monthly submission date.
   - **By trip**: All expenses that occur in a similar time frame are grouped together. A trip report is created when no new expenses have been added for two full days. The report is submitted on the second day, and any new expenses are added to a new trip report.
   - **Manually**: Expenses are automatically added to an open report, but the report will require manual submission. This is a great option for automatically gathering an employee’s expenses on a report while still requiring the employee to review and submit their report.

# FAQ

## I disabled Scheduled Submit. Why do I still get reports submitted by Concierge?

Although an Admin can disable Scheduled Submit for a Workspace, employees can activate Scheduled Submit for their account. If you disable Scheduled Submit but still receive reports from Concierge, the employee has Scheduled Submit activated for their Individual Workspace. 

## What time of day are reports submitted via Scheduled Submit?

All submission times happen in the evening PST (Pacific Standard Time).

## What happens if Scheduled Submit is enabled for both my Individual and Company Workspace?

If Scheduled Submit is enabled on your Individual Workspace and one of your Company Workspaces also has Scheduled Submit enabled, the Company Workspace's submission settings will override the Individual Workspace settings.

## Does Scheduled Submit automatically create separate reports for each of my credit cards?

No, Scheduled Submit collects all expenses into a single report and submits them based on your selected frequency. It does not automatically separate reports by card.

If you need reports organized by card, follow these steps:

- Create separate reports for each card and manually add expenses before submission.
- Use filters to group expenses by card, then assign them to the correct reports before submission.
