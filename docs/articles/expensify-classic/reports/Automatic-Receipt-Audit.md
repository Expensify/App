Concierge Receipt Audit is a real-time, automatic audit and compliance check for receipts submitted by employees and workspace members. Concierge checks every receipt for accuracy and compliance, flagging any expenses that are inaccurate or noncompliant. Flagged expenses are highlighted for manual review, leaving you with more control and visibility into employee expenses.

All Expensify Control plans automatically come with Concierge Receipt Audit. If you have an Expensify Collect plan, you can [upgrade your workspace](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/expensify-billing/Change-Plan-Or-Subscription) to get access to this feature. 

## How Concierge Receipt Audit works

1. Concierge SmartScans every receipt to verify that the data entered by the workspace member matches the currency, date, and amount on the physical receipt.
2. After the report is submitted for approval, Concierge highlights any differences between the SmartScanned values and the employee's chosen input.
3. Each receipt that has been verified is labeled as "Verified."
