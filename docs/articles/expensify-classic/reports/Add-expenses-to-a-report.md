Once you’ve created your expenses, they may be automatically added to an expense report if your company has this feature enabled. If not, your next step will be to add your expenses to a report and submit them for payment. 

You can either create a new report or add expenses to an existing report.

# FAQs

**What’s the difference between expense reports, bills, and invoices?**

- **Expense Report**: Expense reports are submitted by an employee to their employer. This may include reimbursable expenses like business travel paid for with personal funds, or non-reimbursable expenses like a lunch paid for with a company card. 
- **Invoice**: Invoices are reports that a business or contractor will send to another business to charge them for goods or services the business received. For example, a contractor that provides an hourly-rate service (like landscaping) may provide their clients with an invoice to detail the different services and products they provided, how many hours they worked, what their rate per hour is for each service, etc. Invoices are generally expected to be paid within a duration of time (for example, within 30 days of receipt). 
- **Bill**: Each invoice will have a matching bill owned by the recipient so they may use it to pay the invoice sender. Bills are for businesses and contractors who provide their client with a bill for goods or services. For example, a restaurant, store, or hair salon provides bills. Bills are generally expected to be paid upon receipt.
