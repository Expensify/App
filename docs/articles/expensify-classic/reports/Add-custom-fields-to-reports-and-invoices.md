Workspace Admins can add custom fields to reports or invoices to collect important header-level details like project names, business trip purposes, locations, or internal tracking codes.

🔒 **Control plan required and integration limitations:**
- Report fields are only available on the Control plan.
- You cannot create report fields directly in Expensify if you are connected to an accounting integration (QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, Intacct, Xero, or NetSuite).
- Please refer to [the relevant article on this page](https://help.expensify.com/expensify-classic/hubs/connections/) for instructions on creating fields within your accounting integration.
