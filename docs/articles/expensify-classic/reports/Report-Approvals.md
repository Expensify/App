Expensify allows Workspace Admins to create automated workflows for expense report approvals. You can choose from three approval modes:
- **Submit and Close**: Automatically approves reports unless they contain violations.
- **Submit and Approve**: Sends reports to a single designated approver.
- **Advanced Approval**: Enables multi-level approvals for complex workflows.

# Set an Approval Workflow

5. Choose an approval mode:

# Understanding Complex Approval Workflows

## Lifecycle of an Expense Report
1. **Submission**: Reports can be submitted manually or via [Scheduled Submit](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/reports/Automatically-submit-employee-reports).
2. **Category & Tag Approvers**: If assigned, reports first go to these approvers.
3. **Approval Mode**: Reports proceed according to the selected workflow:
   - **Submit & Close**: Auto-closes after submission.
   - **Submit & Approve**: Goes to a single approver.
   - **Advanced Approval**: Travels through a chain of assigned approvers.
4. **Concierge Approval**: If [manual approval](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/reports/Require-review-for-over-limit-expenses) is required, Concierge will approve reports under the limit.
5. **Final Approval & Export**: Once approved, reports can be exported to an [accounting system](https://help.expensify.com/expensify-classic/hubs/connections/).

## Approval Workflow Examples

- **Submit & Close**: Terry and Dana co-run a business and donâ€™t need approval workflows. They set their workspace to **Submit & Close**, so reports are auto-approved.

- **Submit & Approve with Category Approvers**: Pat handles accounting for an engineering firm. Everyone submits reports to Pat, but Dale must approve all Plant and equipment purchases. Dale reviews these expenses before Pat gives final approval.

- **Advanced Approval with Over-Limit Approvers**: Amal submits a report with a $1,200 flight and $950 in accommodations. Jamie, their manager, can approve reports up to $2,000. Since the total exceeds the limit, the report escalates to Lee, who provides final approval before it goes to finance.

# Set a Random Report Audit Schedule

While Expensify automatically flags reports that contain inaccurate or non-compliant expenses for review, you can set a percentage of compliant reports to be audited at random.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Workspaces**.
2. Select the workspace.
3. Click **Members**.
4. Scroll to **Expense Approvals**.
5. In **Randomly route reports for manual approval**, enter a percentage (default: 5%).
6. Click **Save**.
