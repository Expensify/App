# Troubleshooting Verification Errors

## Why is Expensify asking for additional documents?

If automatic verification fails, Concierge may request additional documentation or a letter from your bank. Concierge will message you directly with next steps.

---

## What does “Your bank account is almost set up!” mean?

This message means we’ve sent three test transactions to your bank account. Once you receive them (usually within 1–2 business days), enter the exact amounts to finish setup.

> **Note:** The account is not ready to use until you enter the test amounts.

---

## What if I don’t receive all three test transactions?

After two business days:
- Ask your bank to whitelist Expensify’s ACH IDs:
  - **1270239450**
  - **4270239450**
- Then contact Concierge to re-trigger the transactions.

---

## My bank requires additional security checks

If your bank has 2FA or security verification:
- Complete the security prompt when connecting
- If it fails, close the window and select **Connect manually**

Manual connection allows you to proceed without live login.

# Troubleshooting ID and Video Upload Issues

## I received a “something’s gone wrong” error when adding my ID to Onfido

Check the following:
- Use **Safari (iPhone)** or **Chrome (Android)**
- Allow browser access to camera and microphone
- Clear your web cache
- Close overlapping apps (e.g., Messenger bubbles)
- If on corporate Wi-Fi, check **firewall settings**
- On **iOS 15+**, disable **Hide IP address** in Safari

Try again using a different device if needed.

---

## Why can’t I input my address or upload my ID?

Make sure:
- You’re using a **U.S. address**
- You have a valid **U.S.-issued photo ID** and **SSN**

If not, ask another admin who meets the requirements to add the bank account.

# Ownership and Industry Restrictions

## Should I add a Beneficial Owner if my business is owned by another company?

No. Only enter **individuals** who own **25% or more** of the business.

---
