If another Admin needs access to an existing verified bank account to reimburse employees, the account needs to be shared with them first.

**Note:** Bank accounts can only be shared with Workspace Admins. Both the admin and the bank account owner must have access to the same workspace.

# Share Access to a Verified Business Bank Account

To grant another admin access to the bank account in Expensify:

1. Go to **Settings > Account > Wallet**.
2. Under **Bank Accounts**, click **Share** next to the bank account.
3. Enter the admin's email address you want to grant access to.
4. The added admin will receive an email with instructions to revalidate the bank account.

ðŸš¨ **Important! Revalidation Required** ðŸš¨

When a bank account is shared, it must be revalidated using the test deposits that Expensify sends to the bank account. This process takes **1-2 business days**, during which the admin will receive three microtransactions. Once received, they must validate the transaction amounts.

# Revoke Access to a Verified Business Bank Account

If an admin or accountant leaves the company or no longer needs access to the workspace bank account, you can remove their access:

1. Go to **Settings > Account > Wallet**.
2. Under **Bank Accounts**, click **Unshare** next to the adminâ€™s name.
