<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

To allow an admin to reimburse employees or pay vendor bills, they must be given access to the workspaceâ€™s verified bank account. 

{% include info.html %}
Bank accounts can only be shared with someone who is a Workspace Admin for a workspace you also have access to.
{% include end-info.html %}

To grant another admin access to the bank account in Expensify, 

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Account**.
2. Click the **Payments** tab on the left. 
3. Next to the bank account, click **Share**. 
4. Enter the email address of the person you will share bank account access with. 

The added admin will receive an email with additional instructions to revalidate the bank account. When a bank account is shared, it must be revalidated to ensure the newly added admin has access. It can take 1-2 business days to receive the three microtransactions, then the admin can validate the transaction amounts.
