This article explains how to set up direct reimbursements in AUD for Australian employees using ABA files that can be uploaded to your bank.

# Enable Australian Reimbursements

You can reimburse AUD expenses using **Direct Reimbursement** in Expensify Classic. This method allows employees in Australia to enter their bank account details, which are exported into an `.aba` file. Workspace Admins can upload this file to their bank for reimbursement.

**Note:** An alternative to ABA reimbursement is to set up global reimbursements for AUD bank accounts to reimburse via ACH or wire. 

If you'd like to make direct international payments through Expensify, consider enabling **Global Reimbursements** instead.

# FAQ

## What is an ABA file?

An ABA file is a standardized bank file format used in Australia to process batch payments through online banking.

## Why can't I use direct deposit in AUD?

Australian banks do not support ACH (direct deposit) payments like U.S. accounts. Reimbursements must be processed manually via ABA.

## Can I still reimburse employees internationally?

Yes, you can set up **Global Reimbursements** if you want to process international payments directly through Expensify.
