You can reimburse AUD expenses using **indirect reimbursements**. This allows Australian employees to submit their bank account details in Expensify, which are then provided to you for payment via `.aba` file. A **Workspace Admin** can upload the `.aba` file to the bank to process payments.

**Note:** AUD bank accounts do not use direct deposit or ACH.

If you'd like an option for direct international payments, consider setting up [global reimbursements](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/bank-accounts/Enable-Global-Reimbursements) instead.

3. Navigate to **Settings > Workspaces [Workspace Name] > Workflows**.
4. Scroll to **Make or track payments**
