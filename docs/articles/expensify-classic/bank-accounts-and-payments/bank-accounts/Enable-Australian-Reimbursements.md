{% include info.html %}
AUD bank accounts do not rely on direct deposit or ACH.

For businesses that will also be reimbursing employees in other countries outside of Australia, youâ€™ll need to set up Global Reimbursement instead.
{% include end-info.html %}

You can reimburse AUD expenses using indirect reimbursements. This allows your Australian employees to submit their personal bank account information to Expensify where it will be provided to you for payment via an .aba file. A Workspace Admin can then upload the .aba file to the bank to have payments issued. 

To enable ABA payments,

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Select the desired workspace. 
3. Click the **Reports** tab on the left. 
4. Click the Report Currency dropdown and select **AUD A$**. 
5. Click the **Reimbursement** tab on the left. 
6. Select **Indirect** as the Reimbursement type.
7. Enable the toggle.
