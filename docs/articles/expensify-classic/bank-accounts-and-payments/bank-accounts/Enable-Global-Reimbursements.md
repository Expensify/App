If your company’s business bank account is in the US, Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia, or Singapore, you can send direct reimbursements to nearly any country worldwide! 

The process to enable international reimbursements depends on the currency of your reimbursement bank account, so be sure to review the corresponding instructions below.

# If the Reimbursement Account is in the U.S. (USD)

Before you begin, ensure you have a verified U.S. business bank account connected. Once global reimbursement is enabled on your account, employees receiving payments will connect their **non-USD bank account**.

## Step 1: Connect a U.S Business Bank Account

If you haven't already, follow the instructions to [Connect a US Business Bank Account](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/bank-accounts/Connect-US-Business-Bank-Account). 

## Step 2: Verify the Bank Account for Global Reimbursements

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Workspaces**. 
3. Click the **Reports** tab on the left. 
4. Ensure that the workspace currency is set to **USD**. 
5. Click the **Reimbursements** tab on the left.

7. Click the **Payments** tab on the left.
8. Click **Enable Global Reimbursement** next to the bank account.  
9. Complete the Global Reimbursement DocuSign form.
10. Once the form is complete, it is automatically sent to our Compliance Team for review. 

**Our Support Team will contact you with more details if additional information is required, which may include:** 
- An authorization letter
- Proof of address and ID for the reimburser and/or company directors
- Independently certified documentation, such as a shareholder agreement from a lawyer, notary, or public accountant if an individual owns more than 25% of the company

After the bank account is verified for international payments, set the correct bank account as the reimbursement account:

1. Under **Settings** > **Workspaces** > **Group** > **[Workspace Name]** > **Reimbursements**

# FAQ

## Can multiple people send reimbursements internationally?

## How long does it take to verify an account for global payments?

The verification process can take anywhere from a few business days to several weeks, depending on the information provided in the DocuSign form and if additional information is required for compliance.

Make sure your employee's default workspace is set to the one linked to the bank you're using for global payments. They can confirm their default workspace by following [these steps](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Navigate-multiple-workspaces).
