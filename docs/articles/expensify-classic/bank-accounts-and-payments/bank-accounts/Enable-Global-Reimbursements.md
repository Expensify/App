Enabling global reimbursements allows you to send direct reimbursements to countries worldwide if your company’s bank account is in the US, UK, Canada, Europe, or Australia. 

# For USD accounts

Before you can complete this process, you must first connect a **verified** U.S. bank account, and your employees receiving payments from this account must also connect their **deposit-only** U.S. bank account.

## Step 1: Request global reimbursements

Once your verified U.S. bank account has been added and verified, you can request that global reimbursements be enabled on your account.

Click the support icon in your Expensify account to inform your Setup Specialist, Account Manager, or Concierge that you’d like to enable global reimbursements. They will ask you to confirm the currencies of the bank accounts and determine if your account meets the criteria for global reimbursements.

## Step 2: Re-verify the bank account

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Select the workspace.
3. Click the **Reports** tab on the left. 
4. Ensure that the workspace currency is set to **USD**. 
5. Click the **Reimbursements** tab on the left.
6. Ensure that the reimbursement method is set to **Direct** and that the right bank account is selected. 
7. Click the **Payments** tab on the left.
8. Click **Enable Global Reimbursement** next to the bank account.

**Can multiple people send reimbursements internationally?**

Once your company is authorized to send global payments, the individual who verified the bank account can share it with additional admins on the workspace. This will enable them to be able to send global reimbursements.

**How long does it take to verify an account for global payments?**

The verification process can take anywhere from a few business days to several weeks  depending on the information provided in the DocuSign form, if additional information is required for compliance.

**My employee doesn’t have the option to add their non-USD bank account as a deposit account. What should they do?**

Have the employee double-check that their [default workspace](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Navigate-multiple-workspaces) is set as the workspace that’s connected to the bank you’re using to send global payments. 

**Who is the “Authorized User” and the “User” on the International Reimbursement DocuSign form?**

- **Authorized User**: The person who will process global reimbursements. The Authorized User should be the same person who manages the bank account connection in Expensify.
- **User**: You can leave this section blank because the “User” is Expensify.
