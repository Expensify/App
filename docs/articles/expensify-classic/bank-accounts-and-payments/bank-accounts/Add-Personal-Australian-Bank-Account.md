Australian employees can connect a personal deposit-only bank account to receive reimbursements for their expense reports.  

**Important Notes:**
- The workspace currency must be set to AUD to use ABA batch reimbursements.  
- If your company reimburses employees in multiple countries, set up **[Global Reimbursement](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/bank-accounts/Enable-Global-Reimbursements)** instead.
