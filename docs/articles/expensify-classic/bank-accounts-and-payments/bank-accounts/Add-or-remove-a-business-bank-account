You may be unable to delete a bank account if:
- It is currently used as the **Expensify Card settlement account**
- A **payment is pending** or recently failed

If your account is a settlement account:
- Go to **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Company Cards > Settings**
- Select a different account as the new settlement account before deleting

If your account is locked due to a failed payment:
- Contact Concierge for help resolving the issue before deletion is allowed
