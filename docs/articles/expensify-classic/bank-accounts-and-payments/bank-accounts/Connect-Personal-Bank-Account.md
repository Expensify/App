Employees can connect a personal deposit-only bank account to receive reimbursements for their expense reports. 

To connect a deposit-only account,

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Account**.
2. Click the **Payments** tab on the left.
3. Click **Add Deposit-Only Bank Account**, then click **Connect to your bank**. 
4. Click **Continue**.
5. Search for your bank account in the list of banks and follow the prompts to sign in to your bank account.
   - If your bank doesn’t appear, click the X in the right corner of the Plaid pop-up window, then click **Connect Manually**. You’ll then manually enter your account information and click **Save & Continue**. 
6. Click **Save & Continue**.
7. Enter the name, address, and phone number associated with the account. Then click **Save & Continue**.

You’ll now receive reimbursements for your expense reports and invoices directly to this bank account.

**I connected my deposit-only bank account. Why haven’t I received my reimbursement?**

There are a few reasons why you might not have received a reimbursement: 
- The estimated deposit date on the report has not arrived yet.
- The bank account information is incorrect. If you believe you may have entered the wrong account, contact the Concierge and provide the Report ID for the missing reimbursement.
- Your account wasn’t set up for Direct Deposit/ACH. You can contact your bank to confirm.

**What happens if my bank requires an additional security check before adding it to a third party?**

If your bank account has two-factor authentication (2FA) or another security step enabled, you should be prompted to complete this authentication step when connecting the account to Expensify. However, if you encounter an error during this process, you can close the pop-up window and select Connect Manually to add the account manually.
