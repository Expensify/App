# FAQ

## I received a “something’s gone wrong” error when adding my ID to Onfido.

Check the following:
- Use **Safari (iPhone)** or **Chrome (Android)**.
- Ensure your browser allows **camera and microphone access**.
- Clear your web cache.
- If on corporate Wi-Fi, check your **firewall settings**.
- Close any apps overlapping your screen (e.g., Messenger bubble).
- On **iOS 15+**, disable **Hide IP address** in Safari.

Try again on another device if the issue persists. Contact Concierge for help.

## Should I add a Beneficial Owner if my business is owned by another company?

No, only list **individuals** who own **25% or more** of the business.

## Why can’t I input my address or upload my ID?

Ensure:
- You are entering a **U.S. address**.
- You have a **U.S.-issued photo ID** and **SSN**.

If you don’t meet these requirements, another admin must add the account and share access once verified.

## Why is Expensify asking for additional documents?

If automatic verification fails, manual verification may require documents like:
- **Business address verification**
- **Bank letter confirming account ownership**

For details, contact Concierge Support.

## What if I don’t see all three test transactions?

After two business days, ask your bank to **whitelist Expensify’s ACH IDs:**
- **1270239450**
- **4270239450**

Then contact Concierge to re-trigger the transactions.

## My bank requires an additional security check. What should I do?

If your bank account has two-factor authentication (2FA) or another security step enabled, you should be prompted to complete this authentication step when connecting the account to Expensify. 

If you encounter an error, you can close the pop-up window and select **Connect Manually** to add the bank account manually instead.

## Can I pay employees from a business deposit account?

No, you cannot pay employees if the bank account is set up as a business deposit-only account. To pay employees from that account, head to **Settings > Account > Wallet**, and click **Verify** to upgrade it to a **verified business account**.

## Why haven’t I received my reimbursement?

Check the following:
- The **deposit date** hasn’t arrived yet.
- Your **bank details** are correct.
- Your account supports **Direct Deposit/ACH** (confirm with your bank).

## Are there certain industries or businesses for which Expensify cannot process automatic, in-app payments?

Yes, Expensify **cannot process direct payments** for businesses in:
- Security Brokers & Dealers
- Dating & Escort Services
- Massage Parlors
- Casinos & Gambling/Betting Services
- Non-FI, Money Orders
- Wires, Money Orders
- Government-Owned Lotteries

- Government-Licensed Horse/Dog Racing
- Crypto-currency businesses
- Internet gambling
- Marijuana-related businesses
- Firearm-related businesses (manufacturing and selling)
- NFT (non-fungible token) services

## Why can't I delete a bank account?  

You may be unable to remove your bank account if:  
- It is set as your **Expensify Card settlement account**.  
- Your account is **locked due to a failed payment**.  

If you're unable to delete your bank account, update the settlement account for the Expensify Cards (if applicable), or resolve any outstanding payment issues.

If your business falls into one of these categories, you won’t be able to connect a business bank account to process reimbursements.
