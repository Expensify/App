# Overview

If you want to know more about how and when you’ll be reimbursed through Expensify, we’ve answered your questions below. 

# How to Get Reimbursed 

To get paid back after submitting a report for reimbursement, you’ll want to be sure to connect your bank account. You can do that under **Settings** > **Account** > **Payments** > **Add a Deposit Account**. Once your employer has approved your report, the reimbursement will be paid into the account you added.

## Reimbursement Timing 

### US Bank Accounts

If your company uses Expensify's ACH reimbursement we'll first check to see if the report is eligible for Rapid Reimbursement (next business day). For a report to be eligible for Rapid Reimbursement it must fall under two limits:

 - $100 per deposit bank account per day or less for the individuals being reimbursed or businesses receiving payments for bills.
 - Less than $10,000 being disbursed in a 24-hour time period from the verified bank account being used to pay the reimbursement.

If the request passes both checks, then you can expect to see funds deposited into your bank account on the next business day.

If either limit has been reached, then you can expect to see funds deposited within your bank account within the typical ACH timeframe of 3-5 business days.

### International Bank Accounts

If receiving reimbursement to an international deposit account via Global Reimbursement, you should expect to see funds deposited in your bank account within 4 business days.

## Bank Processing Timeframes

Banks only process transactions and ACH activity on weekdays that are not bank holidays. These are considered business days. Additionally, the business day on which a transaction will be processed depends upon whether or not a request is created before or after the cutoff time, which is typically 3 pm PST.
For example, if your reimbursement is initiated at 4 pm on Wednesday, this is past the bank's cutoff time,  and it will not begin processing until the next business day.
If that same reimbursement starts processing on Thursday, and it's estimated to take 3-5 business days, this will cover a weekend, and both days are not considered business days. So, assuming there are no bank holidays added into this mix, here is how that reimbursement timeline would play out:

**Wednesday**: Reimbursement initiated after 3 pm PST; will be processed the next business day by your company’s bank.
**Thursday**: Your company's bank will begin processing the withdrawal request
**Friday**: Business day 1
**Saturday**: Weekend
**Sunday**: Weekend
**Monday**: Business day 2
**Tuesday**: Business day 3
**Wednesday**: Business day 4
**Thursday**: Business day 5
