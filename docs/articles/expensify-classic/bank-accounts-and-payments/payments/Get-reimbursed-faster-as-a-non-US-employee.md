title: Get Reimbursed Faster as a Non-US Employee
description: How to use Wise to get paid faster
---

If you are an overseas employee who works for a US-based company, you can use Wise to be reimbursed for expenses just as quickly as your US-based colleagues. Wise (formerly TransferWise) is an FCA-regulated global money transfer service. 

Here’s how it works:

1. When you sign up for a Wise account, you are provided with a USD checking account number and a routing number to use as your Expensify bank account. 
2. Once you receive a reimbursement, it will be deposited directly into your Wise account. 
3. You can then convert your funds into 40+ different currencies and withdraw them to your local bank account. If you live in the UK or EU, you can also get a debit card to spend money directly from your Wise account.

## Set up reimbursements through Wise

1. Check with your company to see if you can submit your expenses in USD.
2. Sign up for a Wise Borderless Account and get verified (verification can take up to 3 days).
3. In Expensify, [add a deposit-only bank account](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/bank-accounts/Connect-Personal-US-Bank-Account) with your Wise USD account and ACH routing numbers (NOT the wire transfer routing number).

Do not include spaces in the Wise account number, which should be 16 digits.

If your expenses are not in USD, Expensify will automatically convert them to USD when they are added to your expense report. Once you submit your expenses to your company’s USD workspace and they are approved, you will receive the reimbursement for the approved report total in USD in your Wise account.
