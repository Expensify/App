Workspace Admins can reimburse AUD expense reports by downloading an ABA file containing the accounts needing payment and uploading the file to the bank. This can be done for a single report or for bulk reimbursements.

**Note:** An ABA file is a bank-specific format used to process batch payments in Australia.

Your financial institution may require ABA files to include a self-balancing transaction. If you are unsure, check with your bank. Otherwise, the ABA file may not work with your bank’s internet banking platform.
