This article explains how Workspace Admins can reimburse AUD expense reports in Expensify Classic using Direct Reimbursement and ABA file uploads to their bank. To enable ABA reimbursements, follow the steps in this [article](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/bank-accounts/Enable-Australian-Reimbursements). 

# Reimburse Australian Reports

Workspace Admins can reimburse AUD expense reports by downloading an ABA file that contains the relevant bank account details and uploading it to their financial institution. This process supports both individual and batch reimbursements.

**Note:** An ABA file is a standardized format used to process batch payments in Australia.

Some banks require ABA files to include a self-balancing transaction. If you're unsure whether this applies to your bank, check with them first. Otherwise, the file may not upload correctly via internet banking.
