Workspace Admins can reimburse AUD expense reports by downloading an .aba file containing the accounts needing payment and uploading the file to the bank. This can be done for a single report or for a batch of payments at once.

{% include info.html %}
Your financial institution may require .aba files to include a self-balancing transaction. If you are unsure, check with your bank. Otherwise, the .aba file may not work with your bank’s internet banking platform.
