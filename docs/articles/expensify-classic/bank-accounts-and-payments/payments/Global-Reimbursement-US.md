# FAQ

## Can multiple people send reimbursements?
Yes! Once verified, the primary bank connection owner can share access with other workspace admins.

## How long does it take to verify an account for global payments?
It usually takes a few business days, depending on the completeness of the DocuSign form and any compliance follow-ups.

## Who is the "Authorized User" on the DocuSign form?
This is the person who manages reimbursements and bank setup in Expensify.

## Why can't my employee add a non-USD deposit account?
Make sure your employee's default workspace is set to the one linked to the bank you're using for global payments. They can confirm their default workspace by following [these steps](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Navigate-multiple-workspaces).
