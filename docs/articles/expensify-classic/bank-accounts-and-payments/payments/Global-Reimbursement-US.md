# Step 4: Confirm Test Transactions

1. **Expensify will send test deposits to the provided bank account:** These are small deposits from our global payments partner, **Corpay-Cambridge Mercantile**, and are part of the final verification step.
2. **Check with your bank and let us know once you see them:** These test transactions won't appear in Expensify — you’ll need to monitor your bank account and tell us once they’re received.
3. **We’ll confirm once verification is complete:** After we hear from you, we’ll complete the verification process and let you know when you're ready to start sending international reimbursements.

# Step 5: Start Reimbursing Internationally

Once your U.S. bank account is verified for global reimbursements:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Workflows**.
2. Scroll to **Make or track payments**.
3. Select the verified bank account as the default reimbursement bank account.
4. Instruct employees to connect their deposit account:
   - Go to **Settings > Account > Wallet**.
   - Click **Add deposit-only bank account** to enter their deposit account details.

# FAQ

## Can multiple people send reimbursements?
Yes! Once verified, the primary bank connection owner can share access with other workspace admins.

## How long does it take to verify an account for global payments?
It usually takes a few business days, depending on the completeness of the DocuSign form and any compliance follow-ups.

## Who is the "Authorized User" on the DocuSign form?
This is the person who manages reimbursements and bank setup in Expensify.

## Why can't my employee add a non-USD deposit account?
Make sure your employee's default workspace is set to the one linked to the bank you're using for global payments. They can confirm their default workspace by following [these steps](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Navigate-multiple-workspaces).
