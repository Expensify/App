# FAQ

## What is a PDS FSG?
It stands for Product Disclosure Statement & Financial Services Guide, a legal document sent to the company's directors. The **Corpay PDS FSG** paperwork must be sent to the company directors for signing before onboarding begins.

## Can other admins send global reimbursements?
Yes. Once verified, the reimbursement account can be shared with other workspace admins.

## How long does the full verification process take?
The verification process can take anywhere from a few business days to several weeks, depending on the information provided in the DocuSign form and if additional information is required for compliance.
