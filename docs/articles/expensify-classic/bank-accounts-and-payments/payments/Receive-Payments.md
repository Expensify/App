To receive a reimbursement after submitting an expense report, you must first [connect a personal bank account](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/bank-accounts/Connect-Personal-Bank-Account) to Expensify. Once your employer approves your report or invoice, the reimbursement is deposited directly into your bank account.

**Processing Times:**  
- U.S. and global payments generally take **4-5 business days**:  
  - **2 days** for the business account to process the debit  
  - **2-3 business days** for ACH or wire transfer to your account  
- Payments initiated **after 3 p.m. PST** or on **weekends/bank holidays** may be delayed.  
- If your payment qualifies for **Rapid Reimbursement**, you may receive it sooner.

Your company or client also has the option to pay you via **check, a third-party payment processor, or outside of Expensify**. Check with your **Workspace Admin** or payor to confirm the payment method.

# Global Reimbursements via Wise

For employees outside the U.S., Expensify partners with **Wise (formerly TransferWise)** to enable **faster global reimbursements**.

## How It Works
1. Sign up for a **Wise account** to receive a USD checking account number and ACH routing number.
2. Add these details as a **deposit-only bank account** in Expensify.
3. When your reimbursement is approved, it is deposited into your Wise account.
4. Convert funds into **40+ currencies** or withdraw them to your local bank. **UK and EU users can also request a Wise debit card**.

## Setting Up Wise for Expensify
1. Confirm with your employer if **USD expenses** can be submitted.  
2. Open a **Wise Borderless Account** and complete **verification** (may take up to **3 days**).  
3. Add your **Wise USD account and ACH routing number** to Expensify.  

**Important:** Use the **ACH routing number**, *not* the wire transfer routing number.

Expensify will **automatically convert non-USD expenses** to USD before submission.
