To get paid after submitting a report for reimbursement, you must first connect a personal U.S. bank account or a personal Australian bank account. Then once your employer approves your report or invoice, the reimbursement will be paid directly to your bank account.
Funds for U.S. and global payments are generally deposited within a maximum of four to five business days: 2 days for the funds to be debited from the business bank account, and 2-3 business days for the ACH or wire to deposit into the employee account.

However, banks only process ACH transactions before the daily cutoff (generally 3 p.m. PST) and only on business weekdays that are not bank holidays. This may affect when the payment is disbursed. If the payment qualifies for Rapid Reimbursement, you may receive the payment sooner.

Companies also have the option to submit payments outside of Expensify via check, cash, or a third-party payment processor. Check with your Workspace Admin to know how you will be reimbursed.

# Rapid Reimbursement (U.S. only)

With Expensifyâ€™s ACH reimbursement, payments may be eligible for reimbursement by the next business day with Rapid Reimbursement if they meet the following qualifications:
- **Deposit-only accounts**: Payment must not exceed $100 
- **Verified business bank accounts**: The account does not disburse more than $10,000 within a 24-hour time period.

If the payment amount exceeds the limit, funds will be deposited within the typical ACH time frame of four to five business days.

**Is there a way I can track my payment?**

For U.S. ACH payments and global reimbursements, the expected date of reimbursement is provided at the top of the report and in the comments section of the report. Funds will be deposited within the typical ACH time frame of four to five business days unless the payment is eligible for Rapid Reimbursement. 

**For global payments, what currency is the payment provided in?**

Global payments are reimbursed in the recipient's currency.
