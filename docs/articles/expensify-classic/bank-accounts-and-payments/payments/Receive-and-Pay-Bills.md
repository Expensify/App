# Receiving Bills

Expensify makes it easy to receive bills in three simple ways:  

### 1. Directly from Vendors  
Share your Expensify billing email with vendors to receive bills automatically.  

- Set a Primary Contact under **Settings > Domains > Domain Admins**.  
- Ask vendors to email bills to your billing address: `domainname@expensify.cash` (e.g., for *expensify.com*, use `expensify@expensify.cash`).  
- Once emailed, the bill is automatically created in Expensify, ready for payment.  

### 2. Forwarding Emails  
Received a bill in your email? Forward it to Expensify.  

- Ensure your Primary Contact is set under **Settings > Domains > Domain Admins**.  
- Forward bills to `domainname@expensify.cash`. Example: `domainname@expensify.cash` (e.g., for *expensify.com*, use `expensify@expensify.cash`).  
- Expensify will create a bill automatically, ready for payment.  

### 3. Manual Upload

# Paying Bills in Expensify

Expensify makes it easy to manage and pay vendor bills with a straightforward workflow and flexible payment options. Here’s how it works: 

## Bill Pay Workflow  

1. **SmartScan & Create**: When a vendor sends a bill, Expensify automatically SmartScans the document and creates a bill.  
2. **Submission to Primary Contact**: The bill is submitted to the primary contact, who can review it on the Reports page under their default group policy.  
3. **Communication**: If the approver needs clarification, they can communicate directly with the sender via the invoice linked to the bill.  
4. **Approval Workflow**: Once reviewed, the bill follows your workspace’s approval process. The final approver handles the payment.  
5. **Accounting Integration**: During approval, the bill is coded with the correct GL codes from your connected accounting software. Once approved, it can be exported back to your accounting system. 

## Payment Methods  

Expensify offers several ways to pay bills. Choose the method that works best for you: 

### 1. ACH Bank-to-Bank Transfer
