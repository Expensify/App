## Reimburse via ABA batch file (Australia)

# FAQ

## Is there a maximum reimbursement amount per report?
Yes. Expensify cannot process reimbursements over $20,000. To reimburse a larger amount, split the expenses across multiple reports.

## Why is my business bank account locked?
Your account may be locked due to a failed withdrawal (e.g., insufficient funds or direct debit not enabled).

### To fix it:
- Make sure your bank authorizes direct debits:
  - **ACH Company IDs:** 1270239450 and 4270239450  
  - **ACH Originator Name:** Expensify
- Then:
  1. Go to **Settings > Account > Wallet**
  2. Click **Fix** next to the locked account
  3. Concierge will review and update the account within 4–5 business days

## Who can reimburse reports?
Only Workspace Admins with a verified business bank account can reimburse reports.

## How do I add another employee as a reimburser?
1. Add them as a Workspace Admin:  
   **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members**
2. Share the business bank account:  
   **Settings > Account > Wallet** > Click **Share**
3. The employee enters test deposits to verify access.
4. Once verified, they can reimburse reports.
5. To set them as the default reimburser:  
   **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Workflows > Make or track payments**

## Can I reimburse reports in bulk?
Not directly. However, you can set a threshold to automate reimbursements.

To configure this:
**Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Workflows > Make or track payments**

Reports that are Final Approved and under the threshold will auto-reimburse. Reports over the threshold require manual reimbursement.
