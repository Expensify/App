Streamline your operations by receiving and paying vendor or supplier bills directly in Expensify. Vendors can send bills even if they don't have an Expensify account, and you can manage payments seamlessly.

# Receive Bills in Expensify
You can receive bills in three ways:
- Directly from Vendors: Provide your Expensify billing email to vendors.
- Forwarding Emails: Forward bills received in your email to Expensify.
- Manual Upload: For physical bills, create a Bill in Expensify from the Reports page.

# Bill Pay Workflow
1. When a vendor or supplier sends a bill to Expensify, the document is automatically SmartScanned, and a Bill is created. This Bill is managed by the primary domain contact, who can view it on the Reports page within their default group policy.

2. Once the Bill is ready for processing, it follows the established approval workflow. As each person approves it, the Bill appears in the next approver’s Inbox. The final approver will pay the Bill using one of the available payment methods.

3. During this process, the Bill is coded with the appropriate GL codes from your connected accounting software. After completing the approval workflow, the Bill can be exported back to your accounting system.
