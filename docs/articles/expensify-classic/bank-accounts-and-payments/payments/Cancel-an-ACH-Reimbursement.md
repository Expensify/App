If a report was reimbursed with an ACH payment by mistake or otherwise needs to be canceled, a Workspace Admin with access to the verified bank account can cancel the reimbursement up until it is withdrawn from the payment account.

To cancel an ACH reimbursement,

1. Click the **Reports** tab.
2. Open the report.
3. Click **Cancel Reimbursement**. 
   - If you don’t see the Cancel Reimbursement button, this means your bank has already begun transferring the funds and it cannot be canceled. In this case, you’ll need to contact your bank for cancellation. 
4. Click **Cancel Reimbursement** to confirm cancellation.
