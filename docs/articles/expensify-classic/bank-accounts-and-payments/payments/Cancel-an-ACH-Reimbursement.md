If an ACH reimbursement was processed by mistake or needs to be canceled, a **Workspace Admin** with access to the verified bank account can cancel itâ€”**but only before the funds are withdrawn** from the payment account.

## Cancel an ACH Reimbursement

To cancel an ACH reimbursement:
1. Go to **Reports**.
2. Open the report with the pending ACH reimbursement.
3. Click **Cancel Reimbursement**.
   - If you do not see this option, it means the bank has already started transferring the funds, and cancellation is no longer possible.
4. Click **Cancel Reimbursement** again to confirm.

**Note:** If the reimbursement cannot be canceled within Expensify, you will need to contact your bank directly for assistance.
