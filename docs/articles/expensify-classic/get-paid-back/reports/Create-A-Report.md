# FAQ

## Is there a difference between Expense Reports, Bills, and Invoices?

**Expense Reports** are submitted by an employee to their employer. They contain either personally incurred expenses that the employee should be reimbursed for, or non-reimbursable expenses (such as company card expenses) incurred by the employee that require tracking for accounting purposes.

**Invoices** are reports that a business or contractor will send to another business to charge them for goods or services the business received. Each invoice will have a matching **Bill** owned by the recipient so they may use it to pay the invoice sender.

## Which report type should I use?

If you bought something on a company card or need to be reimbursed by your employer, you’ll need an **Expense Report**. 

If someone external to the business sends you an invoice for their services, you’ll want a **Bill** (or even better - use our Bill Pay process)

## When should I submit my report?

Your Company Admin can answer this one, and they may have configured the workspace’s [Scheduled Submit] setting to enforce a regular cadence for you. If not, you can still set this up under your [Individual workspace].
