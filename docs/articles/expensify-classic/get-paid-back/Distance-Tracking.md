# Overview

Expensify provides a convenient feature for tracking your mileage-related expenses. You'll find all the essential information to begin logging your trips below.

# How to Use Distance Tracking
## Mobile App

First, you’ll want to click the **+** in the top right corner.

If you select **Manually Create**, you’ll be prompted to enter your mileage, select a rate, and code the expense before clicking **Save**.

The **Start GPS** option also exists on the mobile app. However, we’ve learned that most customers prefer to track their mileage after their trips (thus not needing to hit that start button!) 

We’ve temporarily paused the development of GPS mileage tracking in the mobile app, and we recommend you use one of the above options instead! 


## Web

Navigate to the **Expenses** page, click **New Expense**, and review the two **Distance** options.

   - Mileage rate is automatically selected based on your history, or manually select it if it's your first time.
   - Complete any other applicable coding fields.
   - Click **Save**.

# Mileage Tracking FAQs
## **How can I change the rate of my mileage expenses?**
You can change the rate by going to Settings > Workspaces > [Your Workspace] > Expenses > Distance > Add a Mileage Rate.
If you submit mileage expenses on a group workspace, only workspace admins can do this. 

## **Do you plan to add the "Create from Map" option to the mobile app or "Odometer" option to web?**
Not now, but if that changes, you'll be the first to know!

## **Will you restart maintenance on the mobile app's GPS option anytime soon?**
Not now, but if that changes, you'll be the first to know!

## **Does Expensify automatically update IRS Mileage rates?**
  We never automatically update mileage rates in Expensify because different companies want the new rates to become effective on different dates.
