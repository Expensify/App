# Using Your Expensify Visa® Commercial Card

### Activate Your Card
You can start using your card immediately upon receipt by logging into your Expensify account, heading to your Home tab, and following the prompts on the _**Activate your Expensify Card**_ task. 

### Review your Card's Smart Limit
Check your card’s Smart Limit via  _**Settings > Account > Credit Card Import**_: 
- This limit is the total amount of unapproved expenses you can have on the card.
- If a purchase is more than your card's Smart Limit, it will be declined. 

## Managing Expenses
- **Submit Expenses Promptly**: Submit your expenses regularly to restore your full limit. Contact your admin if you need a limit adjustment.
- **Using Your Card**: Swipe your Expensify Card like any other card. You’ll receive instant alerts on your phone for SmartScan receipts. SmartScanned receipts will merge automatically with card expenses.
- **eReceipts**: If your organization doesn’t require itemized receipts, Expensify will generate IRS-compliant eReceipts for all non-lodging transactions.
- **Reporting Expenses**: Report and submit Expensify Card expenses as usual. Approved expenses refresh your Smart Limit.

## Enabling Notifications
Download the Expensify mobile app and enable push notifications to stay updated on spending activity and potential fraud.

## Using Your Virtual Card

- **Purchases**: Use the virtual card for online, in-app, and in-person payments when linked to a mobile wallet (Apple Pay or Google Pay).

#### Adding to a Digital Wallet
To add your Expensify Card to a digital wallet, follow the steps below:
  1. Tap the three-bar icon in the upper-left corner.
  2. Tap _**Settings > Connected Cards**_.
  3. Tap **Add to Apple Wallet** or **Add to Gpay**, depending on your device.
  4. Complete the steps as prompted.

## Handling Declines
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Enable real-time alerts in the mobile app (_**Settings > toggle Receive real-time alerts**_) to get notifications for declines.
- **Common Decline Reasons**:
  - **Insufficient Limit**: Transactions exceeding the available limit will be declined. You can check your limit in _**Settings > Connected Cards**_ or _**Settings > Account > Credit Card Import**_.
  - **Inactive or Disabled Card**: Ensure your card is active and not disabled by your Domain Admin.
  - **Incorrect Information**: Entering incorrect card details (CVC, ZIP, expiration date) will result in declines.
  - **Suspicious Activity**: Transactions may be blocked for unusual or suspicious activity. Check the Expensify Home page to approve unusual merchants. Suspicious spending may prompt a manual due diligence check, during which your cards will be locked.
  - **Restricted Country**: Transactions from restricted countries will be declined.

## Can I use Smart Limits with a free Expensify account? 
If you're on the Free plan, you won't have the option to use Smart Limits. Your card limit will simply reset at the end of each calendar month.
