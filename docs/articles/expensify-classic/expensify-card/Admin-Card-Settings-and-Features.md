# Set and Manage Smart Limits
Smart Limits control spending for individual **Expensify Card** holders or groups. Enabling a Smart Limit activates a card and issues a **virtual Expensify Card** for immediate use.

## Set Limits for Individual Cardholders
As a **Domain Admin**, set or edit Custom Smart Limits:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Company Cards**.
2. Click **Edit Limit**, enter the amount, and save.

- The limit determines how much spending a cardholder can accumulate.
- When the limit is reached, expenses must be submitted for approval before further transactions.
- Setting a Smart Limit to $0 disables the card.

## Set Default Group Limits
To set or update default Smart Limits for a group:
1. Go to **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Groups**.
2. Click the in-line limit for the group and adjust the value.

This applies to all group members who do not have a Custom Smart Limit.

## Refreshing Smart Limits
To enable further spending, approve pending expenses:
1. Go to **Reconciliation**, select a date range, and click **Run**.
2. Click **Unapproved Total** to review pending expenses.
3. Approve expenses or add them to a report.

You can also increase a Smart Limit anytime by clicking **Edit Limit**.

# Check and Adjust Your Domain Limit

Ensure your **Domain Limit** is accurate:
1. **Connect a Bank Account:** Go to **Settings > Account > Payments > Add Verified Bank Account** and connect via Plaid.
2. **Request a Custom Limit:** If your bank is not supported by Plaid:
   - Navigate to **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Company Cards > Request Limit Increase**.
   - Upload three months of unredacted bank statements.

## Factors Affecting Your Domain Limit
- **Available Funds:** Expensify monitors balances via Plaid. A sudden drop in funds may lower your limit.
- **Pending Expenses:** Large pending transactions reduce available funds.
- **Processing Settlements:** Settlements take about three business days, dynamically adjusting your Domain Limit.

**Note:** If your Domain Limit is $0, cardholders cannot make purchases.

## Reconcile Settlements

# Declined Expensify Card Transactions

## Enable real-time alerts to understand declined transactions:
1. Open the **Expensify mobile app**.
2. Tap the menu icon (**≡**) and go to **Settings**.
3. Toggle **Receive real-time alerts** on.

## Common Reasons for Declines

- **Incorrect Card Information:** Mistyped CVC, ZIP code, or expiration date will result in a decline.
- **Suspicious Activity:** Expensify may block flagged transactions.
- **Merchants in a Restricted Country:** Transactions from restricted countries will be declined.

   - Select the correct date range.
   - Check the specific card’s transactions.
2. If the expense isn’t listed, click **Update** next to the card under **Card List** to pull in missing transactions.
3. If the expense is still missing, contact **Concierge** with:
