description: Details on requesting the Expensify Card as an employee
---
To start using the Expensify Card, do the following:
1. **Enable Expensify Cards:** An admin must first enable the cards. Then, an admin can assign you a card by setting a limit, which allows access to the card.
2. **Request the Card:**
   - If you haven’t been assigned a limit, look for the task on your account’s homepage that says, “Ask your admin for the card!”
   - Completing that task will send an in-product notification to your admin team that you requested the card. 
   - Once you’re assigned a card limit, you’ll receive an email notification. Click the link in the email to provide your shipping address on your account’s homepage.
   - Enter your address, and the physical card will be shipped within 3-5 business days.
3. **Activate the Card:** When your physical card arrives, activate it in Expensify by entering the last four digits of the card in the activation task on your homepage.

### Virtual Cards
Once you've been assigned a limit, a virtual card is available immediately. You can view its details via _**Settings > Account > Credit Card Import > Show Details**_.

To protect your account and card spend, enable two-factor authentication under _**Settings > Account > Account Details**_.

### Notifications
- Download the Expensify mobile app and enable push notifications to stay updated on your card’s limit and spending.
- Each transaction triggers a push notification.
- You’ll also get notifications for potentially fraudulent activity, allowing you to confirm or dispute charges.

## Request a Replacement Expensify Card
### If the card is lost, stolen, or damaged Card:
  - Go to _**Settings > Account > Credit Card Import** and click **Request a New Card**_.
  - Confirm your shipping information and complete the prompts. The new card will arrive in 2-3 business days.
  - Selecting “lost” or “stolen” deactivates your current card to prevent fraud. Choosing “damaged” keeps the current card active until the new one arrives.
  - If you can’t access the website or app, call 1-877-751-5848 (US) or +44 808 196 0632 (Internationally) to cancel your card.

### If the card is expiring
- If your card is about to expire, Expensify will notify you via your account’s Home (Inbox) tab. 
- Enter your address if it has changed; otherwise, do nothing, and the new card will ship to your address on file.
- The new card will have a unique number and will not be linked to the old one.

## What if I haven’t received my card after multiple weeks? 

Reach out to support, and we can locate a tracking number for the card. If the card shows as delivered, but you still haven’t received it, you’ll need to confirm your address and order a new one.

## I’m self-employed. Can I set up the Expensify Card as an individual?

Yep! As long as you have a business bank account and have registered your company with the IRS, you are eligible to use the Expensify Card as an individual business owner.
