# Overview

Once your organization is approved for the Expensify Card, you can request a card! 

This article covers how to request, activate, and replace your physical and virtual Expensify Cards.

# How to get your first Expensify Card

An admin in your organization must first enable the Expensify Cards before you can receive a card. After that, an admin may assign you a card by setting a limit. You can think of setting a card limit as “unlocking” access to the card.

If you haven’t been assigned a limit yet, look for the task on your account's homepage that says, “Ask your admin for the card!” This task allows you to message your admin team to make that request.

Once you’re assigned a card limit, we’ll notify you via email to let you know you can request a card. A link within the notification email will take you to your account’s homepage, where you can provide your shipping address for the physical card. Enter your address, and we’ll ship the card to arrive within 3-5 business days.
 
Once your physical card arrives in the mail, activate it in Expensify by entering the last four digits of the card in the activation task on your account’s homepage. 

# Virtual Card

Once assigned a limit, a virtual card is available immediately. You can view the virtual card details via **Settings > Account > Credit Card Import > Show Details**. Feel free to begin transacting with the virtual card while your physical card is in transit – your virtual card and physical card share a limit.

Please note that you must enable two-factor authentication on your account if you want to have the option to dispute transactions made on your virtual card. 

# Notifications

To stay up-to-date on your card’s limit and spending activity, download the Expensify mobile app and enable push notifications. Your card is connected to your Expensify account, so each transaction on your card will trigger a push notification. We’ll also send you a push notification if we detect potentially fraudulent activity and allow you to confirm your purchase. 

# How to request a replacement Expensify Card

You can request a new card anytime if your Expensify Card is lost, stolen, or damaged. From your Expensify account on the web, head to **Settings > Account > Credit Card Import** and click **Request a New Card**. Confirm the shipping information, complete the prompts, and your new card will arrive in 2 - 3 business days.

Selecting the “lost” or “stolen” options will deactivate your current card to prevent potentially fraudulent activity. However, choosing the “damaged” option will leave your current card active so you can use it while the new one is shipped to you.

If you need to cancel your Expensify Card and cannot access the website or mobile app, call our interactive voice recognition phone service (available 24/7). Call 1-877-751-5848 (US) or +44 808 196 0632 (Internationally). 

It's not possible to order a replacement card over the phone, so, if applicable, you would need to handle this step from your Expensify account.

# FAQ

## What if I haven’t received my card after multiple weeks? 

Reach out to support, and we can locate a tracking number for the card. If the card shows as delivered, but you still haven’t received it, you’ll need to confirm your address and order a new one.

## I’m self-employed. Can I set up the Expensify Card as an individual?

Yep! As long as you have a business bank account and have registered your company with the IRS, you are eligible to use the Expensify Card as an individual business owner.
