# Overview

If you're an admin looking to roll out the Expensify Visa® Commercial Card for your organization, you're in the right place. This guide will walk you through the steps to qualify, apply for, and issue the Expensify Card to your employees.

# How to Qualify for the Expensify Card Program

Before you can apply for the Expensify Card, make sure you meet the following prerequisites:

1. **Email Address**: The email associated with your Expensify account must be from a private domain.
2. **Claim Your Domain**: You must claim your private domain in Expensify.
3. **US Business Bank Account**: You need to add and verify a US business bank account to your Expensify account.

### Claim Your Domain

To claim a domain, you must be a workspace admin and use a company email address matching the domain you want to claim. After setting up your account and workspace, go to **Settings > Domains** to claim your domain.

### Add and Verify Your US Business Bank Account

To add your business bank account, go to **Settings > Account > Payments** and click **Add Verified Bank Account**. Follow the setup steps and complete the verification process.

# How to Apply for the Expensify Card

Once your domain is claimed and your business bank account is verified, you can apply for the Expensify Card. You can apply in multiple ways via the web:

### From the Home Page

1. Log into your Expensify account.
2. Go to your account's home page.
3. Find the task titled “Introducing the Expensify Card” and click **Enable my Expensify Cards** to start the application.

### From the Company Cards Page

1. Log into your Expensify account.
2. Go to **Settings > Domains > _Domain Name_ > Company Cards**.
3. Click **Get the Card**.

Once your application is received, we'll review it and send you a confirmation email with next steps.

# How to Issue Cards

After approval, it’s time to set card limits for your employees. When you set a limit, the employee will receive an email and see a task on their home page asking for their shipping address. Once they enter the details, their physical card will be shipped, and a virtual card will be created for immediate use.

### Set a Card Limit for an Employee

1. Go to **Settings > Domains > _Domain Name_ > Company Cards**.
2. Click **Edit Limit** next to the employee who needs a card.
3. Set a limit greater than $0 to issue the card.

### Set Limits for a Group of Employees

If you have a validated domain, you can set limits for multiple employees at once:

1. Go to **Settings > Domains > _Domain Name_ > Groups**.
2. Set a limit for the entire group.

Keep in mind that individual limits will override group limits.

The **Company Cards** page serves as a hub for managing card limits and viewing all employees with cards. You can also see who has requested a card but hasn’t received one yet.
