# Issue Cards

After approval, it’s time to set card limits for your employees. When you set a limit, the employee will receive an email and see a task on their home page asking for their shipping address. Once they enter the details, their physical card will be shipped, and a virtual card will be created for immediate use.

## Set a Card Limit for an Employee

1. Go to **Settings > Domains > _Domain Name_ > Company Cards**.
2. Click **Edit Limit** next to the employee who needs a card.
3. Set a limit greater than $0 to issue the card.

## Set Limits for a Group of Employees

If you have a validated domain, you can set limits for multiple employees at once:

1. Go to **Settings > Domains > _Domain Name_ > Groups**.
2. Set a limit for the entire group.

Keep in mind that individual limits will override group limits.

The **Company Cards** page serves as a hub for managing card limits and viewing all employees with cards. It also shows who has requested a card but hasn’t received one yet.
