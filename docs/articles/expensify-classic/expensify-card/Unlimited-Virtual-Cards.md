# Overview

To issue virtual cards, your company must upgrade to the **Expensify Visa® Commercial Card**.

Once upgraded, admins can issue an **unlimited number of virtual cards** with either a fixed or monthly limit for specific purchases or recurring subscriptions (e.g., Marketing, Advertising, Travel, AWS, etc.).  

Virtual cards are ideal for businesses that need **tight control over spending**. You can set individual spending limits for each virtual card.

Use virtual cards if your company needs:

- One card per vendor or subscription
- Cards for one-time purchases with a fixed amount
- Cards for events or trips
- Cards with a low limit that renews monthly

Admins can name each card for easy tracking and organization. This makes it simple to categorize expenses in the Expensify platform.

# FAQ

## What’s the difference between a fixed limit and a monthly limit?

- **Fixed-limit cards** are ideal for one-time purchases or specific purchases with a set amount.
- **Monthly-limit cards** are best for recurring expenses like subscriptions or memberships.

Both limit types are independent of other cards, including any smart limit cards.

## Where can employees see their virtual cards?

Employees can view their assigned virtual cards by going to **Settings** > **Account** > [**Credit Cards Import**](https://www.expensify.com/settings?param=%7B%22section%22:%22creditcards%22%7D) in their account.

Here, they can see:

- Remaining card limit
- Card type (e.g., fixed or monthly)
- The name of the card

To view card details, they’ll click **Show Details**.

_Note: If the employee hasn’t enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), they will be prompted to enable it before displaying card details. 2FA is required for disputing virtual card charges._

## What should I do if there’s fraud on one of our virtual cards?

If a virtual card is lost, compromised, or you suspect fraud, request a new card immediately. The domain admin can set the card limit to **$0** to terminate it if the employee is unavailable.

When a new card is requested, the old card is immediately deactivated. Always act quickly in the case of fraud to minimize financial impact.
