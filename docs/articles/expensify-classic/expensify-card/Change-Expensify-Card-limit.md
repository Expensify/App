title: Change Expensify Card limit
description: Increase or decrease the limit for an Expensify Card or for a group
---

You can set a limit for each individual **Expensify Card** or for a group within your organization. Here's how to do both:

## Set a Limit per Card

1. Hover over **Settings** and click **Domains**.
2. Select the name of the domain you want to modify.
3. Next to the card, click **Edit Limit**.
4. Make sure the **Custom Smart Limit** toggle is ON. This allows you to set a specific limit for the card. If it's OFF, the card’s limit will default to the group limit.
5. In the **Limit Amount** field, enter the desired limit:
   - **$0** disables the card until the limit is increased.
6. Click **Save**.

## Set a Limit per Group

1. Hover over **Settings** and click **Domains**.
2. Select the name of the domain.
3. Click the **Groups** tab on the left side.
4. In the **Expensify Card Smart Limit** field, enter the desired limit for the group.

# FAQ

**What happens if I set the limit to $0?**  
Setting the limit to $0 will disable the card, meaning it cannot be used until the limit is increased.

**Can I set different limits for different employees?**  
Yes, you can set individual card limits by enabling the **Custom Smart Limit** toggle. Without this, the employee's card will follow the group’s limit.
