# Disputing Expensify Card Transactions

If you notice issues with a transaction on your Expensify Visa® Commercial Card, you may need to file a dispute. Common transaction errors include:

- Unauthorized charges
- Incorrect transaction amounts
- Duplicate charges
- Missing merchant refunds

When a dispute is necessary, follow the steps below to resolve it.

## How to Dispute a Transaction

If you find an error on your Expensify Card transaction, contact us right away at [concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com). We’ll ask you a few questions to understand the situation, then start a dispute on your behalf with our card processor.

## Common Types of Disputes

Here are the most common reasons for disputes:

- Unauthorized or fraudulent transactions
- Service disputes

### Unauthorized or Fraudulent Transactions

These types of disputes occur when:

- Charges are made after your card is lost or stolen
- There are unauthorized charges while your card is still in your possession (indicating possible compromised card information)
- Recurring charges continue after a subscription is canceled

**To protect your account from further unauthorized charges:**

1. **Cancel your card**:  
  Go to **Settings** > **Account** > **Credit Card Import** > **Request A New Card**.
   
2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:  
   Activate 2FA for added security under **Settings** > **Account** > **Account Details** > **Two-Factor Authentication**.

### Service Disputes

These disputes involve issues with the product or service, such as:

- Damaged or defective merchandise
- Merchandise that was never received
- Double charges (e.g., you paid with another method, like cash)
- No refund after returning an item
- Multiple charges for a single transaction
- Charges made for the wrong amount

For service-related disputes, contact the merchant first. This is usually the fastest way to resolve the issue.

## Tips for a Smooth Dispute Process

To ensure your dispute is resolved quickly:

- Provide detailed information about the transaction and the issue. Explain why you're disputing the charge and any steps you’ve taken to address it.
- If you recognize the merchant but not the charge, contact the merchant first.
- Include supporting documents, like receipts or cancellation confirmations. While not required, they can help increase the chances of a successful resolution.
- Ensure the transaction isn’t pending, as pending charges cannot be disputed.
