# Overview
When using your Expensify Card, you may come across transaction errors, which can include things like:
- Unrecognized, unauthorized, or fraudulent charges.
- Transactions of an incorrect amount.
- Duplicate charges for a single transaction.
- Missing a promised merchant refund.

You’ll find all the relevant information on handling these below.

# How to Navigate the Dispute Process
## Disputing a Transaction

If you spot an Expensify Card transaction error, please contact us immediately at [concierge@expensify.com](mailto:concierge@expensify.com). After that, we'll ask a few questions to better understand the situation. If the transaction has already settled in your account (no longer pending), we can file a dispute with our card processor on your behalf.

If you suspect fraud on your Expensify Card, don't hesitate to cancel it by heading to Settings > Account > Credit Card Import > Request A New Card. Better safe than sorry!

Lastly, if you haven’t enabled Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) yet, please do so ASAP to add an additional layer of security to your account.

## Types of Disputes

There are two main dispute types:

1. Unauthorized charges/fraud disputes, which include:
   - Charges made with your card after it was lost or stolen.
   - Unauthorized charges while your card is still in your possession (indicating compromised card information).
   - Continued charges for a canceled recurring subscription.

2. Service disputes, which include:
   - Received damaged or defective merchandise.
   - Charged for merchandise but never received it.
   - Double-charged for a purchase made with another method (e.g., cash).
   - Made a return but didn't receive a timely refund.
   - Multiple charges for a single transaction.
   - Charges settled for an incorrect amount.

You don't need to categorize your dispute; we'll handle that. However, this may help you assess if a situation warrants a dispute. In most cases, the initial step for resolving a dispute should be contacting the merchant, as they can often address the issue promptly.

## Simplifying the Dispute Process

To ensure the dispute process goes smoothly, please:
- Provide detailed information about the disputed charge, including why you're disputing it, what occurred, and any steps you've taken to address the issue.
- If you recognize the merchant but not the charge, and you've transacted with them before, contact the merchant directly, as it may be a non-fraudulent error.
- Include supporting documentation like receipts or cancellation confirmations when submitting your dispute to enhance the likelihood of a favorable resolution.
