# Disputing Expensify Card Transactions
While using your Expensify VisaÂ® Commercial Card, you might encounter transaction errors, such as:
- Unauthorized transaction activity
- Incorrect transaction amounts.
- Duplicate charges for a single transaction.
- Missing merchant refunds.

When that happens, you may need to file a dispute for one or more transactions. 

## Disputing a Transaction
If you notice a transaction error on your Expensify Card, contact us immediately at concierge@expensify.com. We will ask a few questions to understand the situation better, and file a dispute with our card processor on your behalf.

## Types of Disputes
The most common types of disputes are:
- Unauthorized or fraudulent disputes
- Service disputes

### Unauthorized or fraudulent disputes
- Charges made after your card was lost or stolen.
- Unauthorized charges while your card is in your possession (indicating compromised information).
- Continued charges for a canceled recurring subscription.

**If there are transactions made with your Expensify Card you don't recognize, you'll want to do the following right away:**
1. Cancel your card by going to _**Settings > Account > Credit Card Import > Request A New Card**_.
2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for added security under _**Settings > Account > Account Details > Two Factor Authentication**_.

### Service Disputes
- Received damaged or defective merchandise.
- Charged for merchandise that was never received.
- Double-charged for a purchase made with another method (e.g., cash).
- Made a return but didn't receive a refund.
- Multiple charges for a single transaction.
- Charges settled for an incorrect amount.

For service disputes, contacting the merchant is often the quickest way to resolve the dispute.

## Simplifying the Dispute Process
To ensure a smooth dispute process, please:
- Provide detailed information about the disputed charge, including why you're disputing it and any steps you've taken to address the issue.
- If you recognize the merchant but not the charge, contact the merchant directly.
- Include supporting documentation (e.g., receipts, cancellation confirmations) when submitting your dispute to increase the chances of a favorable resolution (recommended but not required).
- Make sure the transaction isn't pending (pending transactions cannot be disputed).

The dispute process generally takes up to 90 days. It depends on the type of dispute.

Contact Concierge if you've filed a dispute and want to cancel it. You might do this if you recognize a previously reported unauthorized charge or if the merchant has already resolved the issue.
