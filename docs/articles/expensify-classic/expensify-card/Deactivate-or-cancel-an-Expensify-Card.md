# For Domain Admins

To deactivate an employee’s Expensify Card:

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Domains**.
2. Click the name of the domain.
3. Next to the card, click **Edit Limit**.
4. Enable the **Custom Smart Limit** toggle to set a specific card limit. If not enabled, the card limit will match the group limit.
5. Set the **Limit Amount** to $0. Adjusting the Smart Limit to $0 temporarily deactivates the card. The card will only be reactivated if the limit is increased.
6. Click **Save**.
7. Instruct the cardholder to cancel their Expensify card by following the **[For Cardholders](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/expensify-card/Deactivate-or-cancel-an-Expensify-Card#for-cardholders)** section above.  

**Important:** If you suspect fraudulent access to a Domain Admin account, contact Concierge Support via the in-app chat or email at concierge@expensify.com. If necessary, we can temporarily manually suspend cards outside of the Expensify Domain.
