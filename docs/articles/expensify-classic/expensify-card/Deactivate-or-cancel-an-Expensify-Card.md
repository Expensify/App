A cardholder can cancel an Expensify Card themselves, or a Domain Admin can deactivate it. 

**Below are some examples of when to cancel or deactivate a card:**
- After a fraudulent or suspicious charge

- After an employee leaves the company

# For Domain Admins

To deactivate an employee's Expensify Card:
1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Domains**.  
2. Click the name of the domain.  
3. Next to the card, click **Edit Limit**.  
4. Enable the **Custom Smart Limit** toggle to set a specific card limit. If not enabled, the card limit will match the group limit.  
5. Set the **Limit Amount** to $0. Adjusting the Smart Limit to $0 temporarily deactivates the card. The card will only be reactivated if the limit is increased.  
6. Click **Save**.  

**Important:** If you suspect fraudulent access to a Domain Admin account, contact Concierge Support via the in-app chat or email at concierge@expensify.com. If necessary, we can temporarily manually suspend cards outside of the Expensify Domain.
