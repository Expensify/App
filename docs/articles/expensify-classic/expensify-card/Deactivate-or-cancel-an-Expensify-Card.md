<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

A cardholder can cancel an Expensify Card themselves, or a Domain Admin can deactivate it. You may want to cancel or deactivate a card:
- After a fraudulent or suspicious charge
- When an Expensify Card is lost or damaged
- After an employee leaves the company

# Cardholders

To cancel an Expensify Card assigned to you,

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Account**.
2. Click the **Credit Card Import** tab.
3. Click **Request a New Card** next to the card.
4. Choose a reason.
5. Confirm your address details for shipping a new card.
6. Consult this [guide](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/expensify-card/Dispute-A-Transaction) for how to dispute fraudulent transactions (where relevant).
   
# Domain Admins

To deactivate an employee's Expensify Card as a Domain Admin,

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Domains**.
2. Click the name of the domain.
3. Next to the card, click **Edit Limit**.
4. Ensure the Custom Smart Limit toggle is enabled to be able to set a specific card limit. Otherwise, the card limit will be determined by the limit set for the group that the employee is in.
5. In the Limit Amount field, set the limit to $0. The card will be disabled for use until the limit is increased.
6. Click **Save**.

Note: If you have concerns about fraudulent access to a Domain Admin's user account, please message Concierge or email concierge@expensify.com immediately. If necessary, our support team can manually suspend Expensify cards outside of the Expensify Domain as a temporary measure if your account is compromised.
