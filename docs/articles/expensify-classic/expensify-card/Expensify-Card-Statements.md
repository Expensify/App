2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Select either **Daily** or **Monthly** from the dropdown menu.

- The total settlement amount is withdrawn from your Verified Business Bank Account, resetting your card balance to $0.
- To change your settlement frequency or bank account:
  1. Go to **Settings > Domains > [Your Domain Name] > Company Cards**.
  2. Click the **Settings** tab.
  3. Select new options from the dropdown menu.
  4. Click **Save** to confirm.
