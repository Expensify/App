**To secure your account:**
1. **Cancel your card:** Go to **Settings > Account > Wallet > Request a New Card**.
2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Activate 2FA under **Settings > Account > Profile > Two-Factor Authentication**.

## Service Disputes

- Incorrect charge amounts

**Tip:** Always contact the merchant first, as they may resolve the issue faster.

# Tips for a Smooth Dispute Process

- Clearly explain the dispute reason and any steps taken.
- If you recognize the merchant but not the charge, contact them first.
- Provide supporting documents (e.g., receipts, cancellation confirmations).
