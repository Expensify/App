## Service Disputes

**Tip:** Always contact the merchant first, as they may resolve the issue faster.

# Tips for a Smooth Dispute Process

- Clearly explain the dispute reason and any steps taken.
- If you recognize the merchant but not the charge, contact them first.
- Provide supporting documents (e.g., receipts, cancellation confirmations).
