# How to sign up for an Individual Subscription
## Website
To activate an Individual Subscription from the web:
1. Log into your Expensify account
2. Navigate to **Settings > Workspaces > Individual**
3. Click **Activate Subscription** under **Monthly** 
4. If you don't already have a billing card associated with your account, you will be prompted to add one

Once payment is complete, you’re all set!

## Mobile App: 
1. Tap **Settings**
2. Under the Workspaces section, select **Free Trial**
3. Select **Upgrade**
4.Tap **Subscription** to upgrade your account


# How to manage the subscription
## Web and Android:
When you buy a subscription on the web or through an Android device, you'll be asked to enter your billing information immediately. After the purchase, you can easily view or cancel your subscription anytime by going to **Settings > Workspaces > Individual > Subscription > Show Details**.

## iOS: 
If you purchase a monthly subscription on an iOS device, it will be managed, including cancellations, through the App Store rather than within the Expensify app. You can learn how to manage App Store Subscriptions here.  

After purchasing the subscription from the App Store, remember to sync your app by:
1. Log into the Expensify mobile app
2. Click the three bars in the upper left corner
3. Scroll to **Settings**
4. Select **Sync Account**

The subscription renewal date is the same as the purchase date. For instance, if you sign up for the subscription on September 7th, it will renew automatically on October 7th. You can cancel your subscription anytime during the month if you no longer need unlimited SmartScans. If you do cancel, keep in mind that your subscription (and your ability to SmartScan) will continue until the last day of the billing cycle.


# FAQ
## Can I use an Individual Subscription while on a Collect or Control Plan? 
You can! If you want to track expenses separately from your organization’s Workspace, you can sign up for an Individual Subscription. However, only Submit and Track Workspace plans are available when on an Individual Subscription. Collect and Control Workspace plans require an annual or pay-per-use subscription. For more information, visit expensify.com/pricing.

## Can I cancel an Individual Subscription anytime? 
Yep! You can cancel an Individual Subscription anytime. 

## How do I cancel my subscription?
Follow the steps below to cancel a Monthly Subscription started via the website or Android app:

2. Navigate to **Settings > Workspace > Individual > Subscriptions**
3. Click the **Cancel Subscription** button to cancel your Monthly Subscription
   
Your subscription is a pre-purchase for 30 days of unlimited SmartScanning. This means when you cancel you do not get a refund and instead get to use the remainder of the month of unlimited SmartScanning you purchased.
