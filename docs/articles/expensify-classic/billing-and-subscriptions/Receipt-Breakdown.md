description: This article goes over the Expensify receipt for billing owners.

# Overview
This article will give you (the billing owner) a detailed breakdown of your Expensify bill. 

Your receipt is broken up into multiple sections that include:
1. A high-level summary of your total Expensify bill
2. Ways to reduce your bill and get paid to use Expensify
3. A billing breakdown that covers all activity and discounts
4. An activity breakdown by workspace

## How-to understand the high-level summary
The top section will show the total amount you paid as the billing owner of Expensify workspaces and give you a breakdown of price per member. Every member of your workspace(s) gets to store data, review data, and access free features like Expensify Chat. Thus, we show the total price and then use all of the members across all of the workspaces you own to calculate the price per member. Further down in the receipt, and in this article, we break down the members who generated billable activity.

## How-to reduce your bill and get paid to use Expensify
Chances are you can actually get paid to use Expensify with the Expensify Card. In this section of the receipt, we outline how much money you're leaving on the table by not using the Expensify Card. You can click `Get started` to connect with your account manager (if you have one) or Concierge, both of whom can help get you started with the card. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
_Note: Currently, we offer Expensify Cards to companies with USD bank accounts._
