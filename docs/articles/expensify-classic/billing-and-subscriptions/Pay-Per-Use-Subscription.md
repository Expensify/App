# Overview
Pay-per-use is a billing option for people who prefer to use Expensify month to month or on an as-needed basis. On a pay-per-use subscription, you will only pay for active users in that given month. 

**We recommend this billing setup for companies that use Expensify a few months out of the year**. If you have expenses to manage for more than 6 out of 12 months, an [**Annual Subscription**](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/billing-and-subscriptions/Annual-Subscription)  may better suit your needs. 

# How to start a pay-per-use subscription 
1. Create a Group Workspace if you haven’t already by going to **Settings > Workspaces > Group > New Workspace** 
2. Once you’ve created your Workspace, under the “Subscription” section on the Group Workspace page, select “Pay-per-use”.

# FAQ

## What is considered an active user? 
An active user is anyone who chats, creates, modifies, submits, approves, reimburses, or exports a report in Expensify. This includes actions taken by a Copilot and Workspace automation (such as Scheduled Submit and automated reimbursement). If no one on your Group Workspace uses Expensify in a given month, you will not be billed for that month.

You can review the number of Active Users by selecting “View Activity” next to your billing receipt (**Settings > Account > Payments > Billing History**).

## Why do I have pay-per-use users in addition to my Annual Subscription on my Expensify bill?
If you have an Annual Subscription, but go above your set user count, we will charge at the pay-per-use rate for these ad-hoc users.

If you expect to have an increased number of users for more than 3 out of 12 months, the most cost-effective approach is to increase your Annual Subscription size.

## Will billing only be in USD currency?
While USD is the default billing currency, we also have GBP, AUD, and NZD billing currencies. You can see the rates on our [pricing](https://www.expensify.com/pricing)  page.
