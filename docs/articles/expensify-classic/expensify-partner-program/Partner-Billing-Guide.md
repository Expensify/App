# Exclusive Partner Pricing

ExpensifyApproved! Partners enjoy special pricing with flexibility based on Expensify Card usage:
- **Bundled Pricing:** US clients using the Expensify Card receive up to a **50% discount**, reducing the monthly fee to **$9/seat**. Contact your Partner Manager for international pricing discounts.
- **Unbundled Pricing:** Clients **not** using the Expensify Card are billed at **$18/seat** monthly.
- **No Annual Commitment:** Pay per use without the need for an annual subscription.
- **Expensify Card Revenue Share:** Partners receive a **0.5% revenue share** on client Expensify Card transactions. This revenue can be passed back to clients as an additional discount.

# Understanding the Billing Process

Expensify bills the **expense workspace owner** for all activity within that workspace. If an accountant owns the client’s workspace, they receive the bill and can re-bill clients accordingly.

Each month, Expensify issues a consolidated bill detailing:
- **Pay-per-use seats:** The number of active clients and their users for the month.
- **Expensify Card discount:** Reflects the discount earned based on card usage.
- **Total monthly cost:** The final amount after applying Expensify Card discounts.
- **Workspace list:** An overview of client workspaces and their active seats.

## Consolidated Domain Billing

**Consolidated Domain Billing** centralizes all client billing under a single Expensify account, simplifying payments.

**How to Activate Consolidated Domain Billing:**
1. Claim and verify your firm's domain.
2. Go to **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Domain Admins**.
3. Assign a **Primary Domain Admin** using the dropdown selector.
4. Enable **Consolidated Domain Billing** in the same section.

This ensures all workspace bills are managed under one account, eliminating the need for multiple payment methods across clients.

## Managing Multiple Client Workspaces

To efficiently oversee all client workspaces, create a **centralized admin account**, such as `accounting@myfirm.com`.

**Setting Up a Centralized Console:**
1. Create a dedicated email for managing client workspaces (e.g., `accounting@myfirm.com`).
2. Register and verify this email with Expensify.
3. Add this email as a **Workspace Admin** in each client’s workspace settings.
4. Repeat this step for all **client domains**.

## Using Client IDs for Optimized Billing

**Client IDs** help partners track and manage billing efficiently by assigning unique identifiers to workspaces.

**Assigning a Client ID to a Workspace:**
1. Log in to your **ExpensifyApproved! accountant account**.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Overview**.
3. Input a unique **alphanumeric client ID** for the workspace.

**Note:** Ensure consistency in client IDs if a client has multiple workspaces.
