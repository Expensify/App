title: Expensify Card revenue share for ExpensifyApproved! partners
description: Earn money when your clients adopt the Expensify Card
---
You can now earn additional income for your firm every time your client uses their Expensify Card. In short, your firm gets 0.5% of your clients’ total Expensify Card spend as cash back. The more your clients spend, the more cashback your firm receives!

This program is currently only available to US-based ExpensifyApproved! partner accountants.

# Become a Domain Admin
To benefit from this program, you or a member of your firm must be a domain admin on the client’s domain in Expensify:
1. Head to *Settings > Domains*
2. Click the client's domain
     - If you can click on the domain and access the domain settings, you are a Domain Admin
     - If you’re not a Domain Admin, your client can add you as one by heading to **Settings > Domains > [Client's Domain] > Domain Admins > Add Admin**.

_**Note:** You can view all domain admins under Settings > Domains > [Client's Domain] > Domain Admins._

## What if my firm is not permitted to accept revenue share from our clients?

We understand that different firms may have different policies. If your firm is unable to accept this revenue share, you can pass the revenue share back to your client to give them an additional 0.5% of cash back using your own internal payment tools.
