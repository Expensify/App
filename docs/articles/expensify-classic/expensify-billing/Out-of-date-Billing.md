title: Out-of-date Billing
description: What to do if you receive an out-of-date billing notification
---

A notification that your workspace has out-of-date billing will appear for one of the following reasons:

- A workspace you’re an Admin for has an expired/invalid payment card or insufficient funds.
- Your company’s Expensify trial has ended and it’s time to [upgrade your subscription](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/expensify-billing/Change-Plan-Or-Subscription).

## Step 1: Determine who the billing owner is

1. Hover over **Settings** and click **Workspaces**.
2. Click the name of the workspace that has the `!` symbol next to it.
3. Review who is listed as the Billing Owner.
4. Have this person complete the steps below, or you can click **Take Over Billing** if you will take over handling payments for the Expensify workspace. 

## Step 2: Retry payment or update the payment card

1. Ensure that the card or bank account has sufficient funds for the payment.

3. Click the **Payments** tab on the left.
4. Click **Retry Billing** if there were originally insufficient funds in the payment account, or click **Add Payment Card** to add a payment method.  

Once the payment is processed, the out-of-date billing notification will disappear.
