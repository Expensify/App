description: Learn how to enable and manage Consolidated Domain Billing, allowing one billing owner to cover all paid workspaces under a verified domain.

# Overview
Consolidated Domain Billing allows organizations to have different billing owners for workspaces while ensuring that only one person is billed for all paid workspaces within a verified domain.

---

# Enabling Consolidated Domain Billing
To enable this feature, you must first claim and verify your domain:

1. Go to **Settings > Domains**.
2. Select your domain.
3. Click on a setting such as **Groups**.
4. Click **Verify**.

Once your domain is verified, enable Consolidated Domain Billing:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Domains > [Your Domain]**.
2. Select **Domain Admins > Primary Contact and Billing**.
3. Toggle **Consolidated Domain Billing** on.

# How It Works
When a **Domain Admin** enables Consolidated Domain Billing:

- All **Group Workspaces** owned by users with an email address matching the domain will be billed to the **Primary Contact** listed under **Domain Admins**.
- Individual workspace billing owners will no longer receive separate charges.

---

# Best Practices
- **When to Use It**: If multiple billing owners exist in your organization but you want a single, consolidated bill.
- **When to Avoid It**: If you need to keep workspace billing separate for accounting or financial tracking purposes.
- **Annual Subscription Considerations**:
  - If you have an **Annual Subscription**, Consolidated Domain Billing will combine the amounts due for each Group workspace billing owner.
  - To maximize savings, the **Primary Contact** should also be the billing owner for all Group Workspaces.
