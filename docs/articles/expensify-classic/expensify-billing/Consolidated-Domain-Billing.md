# How It Works

When a **Domain Admin** enables Consolidated Domain Billing:

- All Group Workspaces owned by users with an email address matching the domain will be billed to the Primary Contact listed under Domain Admins.
- Individual workspace billing owners will no longer receive separate charges.

# Best Practices

- **When to Use It**: If multiple billing owners exist in your organization, but you want a single, consolidated bill.
- **When to Avoid It**: If you need to keep workspace billing separate for accounting or financial tracking purposes.
- **Annual Subscription Considerations**:
  - If you have an **Annual Subscription**, Consolidated Domain Billing will combine the amounts due for each Group workspace billing owner.
  - To maximize savings, the **Primary Contact** should also be the billing owner for all Group Workspaces.
