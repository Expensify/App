# Overview
If your organization is recognized by the IRS or other local tax authorities as tax-exempt, that means you don’t need to pay any tax on your Expensify monthly bill.  Please follow these instructions to request tax-exempt status.
# How to request tax-exempt status in Expensify
1. Go to **Settings > Account > Payments**. 
1. Click on the option that says **Request Tax-Exempt Status**.
1. After you've requested tax-exempt status, Concierge (our support service) will start a conversation with you. They will ask you to upload a PDF of your tax-exempt documentation. This document should include your VAT number (or "RUT" in Chile). You can use one of the following documents: 501(c), ST-119, or a foreign tax-exempt declaration.
1. Our team will review your document and let you know if we need any more information.
1. Once everything is verified, we'll update your account accordingly.

Once your account is marked as tax-exempt, the corresponding state tax will no longer be applied to future billing. 

If you need to remove your tax-exempt status, let your Account Manager know or contact Concierge.

## What happens to my past Expensify bills that incorrectly had tax added to them? 
Expensify can provide a refund for the tax you were charged on your previous bills. Please let your Account Manager know or contact Concierge if this is the case.
