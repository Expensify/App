# Personal Karma

Personal Karma allows individual users to automatically donate a small percentage of their monthly added expenses to Expensify.org.

For every $500 of expenses added, you’ll donate $1 to a related Expensify.org fund. All reported and unreported expenses, including invoice expenses, on the Expenses page are calculated to get the donation amount. Each month, Expensify will charge the billing card on file for the donation amount, and you’ll receive a donation receipt via email.

The fund from your Personal Karma is determined by the expense's MCC (Merchant Category Code). Each MCC supports one of Expensify.org's funds: Climate Justice, Food Security, Housing Equity, Reentry Services, and Youth Advocacy.

## Corporate Karma
