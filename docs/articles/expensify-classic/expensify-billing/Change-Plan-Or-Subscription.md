Expensify offers several plans based on your needs: **Track, Submit, Collect, Control,** and **Free**. Your choice depends on whether you manage expenses individually or for a group or company. You may need to upgrade if you hire employees who need access to a **Group Workspace** or require features exclusive to paid plans.

# FAQ

## Will I be charged for a monthly subscription even if I don't use SmartScans?

Yes, monthly subscriptions are prepaid and not usage-based, so you will be charged regardless of activity.

## I'm in a Group Workspace. Do I need the monthly subscription too?
No, Group Workspace members already have unlimited **SmartScans**. However, you can keep a subscription for personal use if you leave your company's Workspace.
