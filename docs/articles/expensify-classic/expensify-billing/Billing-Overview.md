# Billing Overview

Here’s everything you need to know about how Expensify bills for Collect and Control plans. Learn how pricing works, who gets billed, and how to transfer billing ownership.

## Billing and Subscriptions

Expensify has two plans: **Collect** and **Control**.

Collect is perfect for small teams that need an easy way to track receipts and get reimbursed, while Control is built for growing businesses that want more control over spending, smoother approvals, and smarter policy automation.

2. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Overview > Take Over Billing**  
3. The new owner adds a payment card and will be billed starting on the 1st of the next month

## FAQ

### Why am I being charged more than $5 per user for a Collect plan?

The Collect plan pricing changed in April 2025. If your first workspace was created before April 1, 2025, your billing is based on the previous pricing structure. Contact Concierge or your Account Manager if you need help understanding your charges.
