# FAQ

## Why am I being charged more than $5 per user for a Collect plan?

The Collect plan pricing changed in **April 2025**. If your first workspace was created **before April 1, 2025**, your billing is based on the **previous pricing structure**. Contact **Concierge or your Account Manager** if you need help understanding your charges.
