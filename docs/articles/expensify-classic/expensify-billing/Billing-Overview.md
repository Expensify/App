Expensify’s billing is based on monthly member activity. You’ll be charged for the previous month’s usage at the beginning of each month. Your bill depends on:  
- Plan type: Annual subscription or pay-per-use.  
- Expensify Visa® Commercial Card usage: Discounts are available based on your card spending.

# How Billing Works
- Billing occurs on the first of each month for the previous month’s usage.
- Only Group Workspace owners are billed.  
- View billing receipts in:  
  Settings > Account > Payments > Billing History.

**Tip: Designate one billing owner for all Group Workspaces to streamline billing management.**

## What is an Active Member?
An active member is anyone who performs any of these actions in Expensify during a month:
- Chats  
- Creates, submits, approves, reimburses, or exports a report  
- Uses the Copilot feature to take an action in another user's account

# Annual Subscription

## Key Benefits:
- Save 50% per active member compared to pay-per-use billing.  
  - Collect plan: $10 per member (vs. $20).  
  - Control plan: $18 per member (vs. $36).  
- Set your monthly active member count upfront and pay a fixed rate.

## How It Works:
- You’ll be billed for the number of members set in your subscription.  
- Extra active members beyond your subscription size are charged at the pay-per-use rate.

**Example:**
- Plan: Control  
- Subscription size: 10 members  
  - Cost: $18/member x 10 members = $180/month
- Scenario: 12 active members in one month  
  - Cost for additional two members: $36/member = $72  
  - Total bill: $252

**Adjustments:**
- You can increase your subscription size by extending your subscription period.  
- Reductions are only allowed after your current subscription ends.
