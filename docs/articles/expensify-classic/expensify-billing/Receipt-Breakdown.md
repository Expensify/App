title: Receipts Breakdown
description: This article goes over the Expensify receipt for billing owners.
---
**Your receipt is broken up into the following sections:**
- A high-level summary of your total Expensify bill
- Ways to reduce your bill and get paid to use Expensify
- A billing breakdown that covers all activity and discounts
- An activity breakdown by workspace

## A high-level summary

- The top section will show the total amount you paid as the billing owner of Expensify Workspaces and give you a breakdown of the price per member.
- Every member of your workspace(s) can store data, review data, and access free features like Expensify Chat.
- We show the total price and then calculate the price per member by using the number of members across all of the workspaces you own.
- Further down in the receipt, there's a breakdown of the members who generated billable activity.

## Reduce your bill and get paid to use Expensify
Chances are you can actually get paid to use Expensify with the Expensify Card. In this section of the receipt, we outline how much money you're leaving on the table by not using the Expensify Card. You can click `Get started` to connect with your account manager (if you have one) or Concierge, both of whom can help get you started with the card.  

_Note: Currently, we offer Expensify Cards to companies with US bank accounts._
