<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

Capture group and event expenses with Attendee Tracking by documenting who attended and the cost per attendee. The amount is always divided evenly between all attendees—different amounts cannot be allocated to specific attendees. To divide the amounts differently, you’ll first have to split the expense. 

{% include info.html %}
Attendees added to an expense will not be notified that they were added to an expense, nor will they share in the expense or be requested to pay for any portion of the expense. 
{% include end-info.html %}

{% include selector.html values="desktop, mobile" %}

{% include option.html value="desktop" %}
1. Click the **Expenses** tab. 
2. Click the expense you want to add attendees to.
3. Click the attendees field and enter the name or email address of the attendee.
   - If the attendee is a member of your workspace, you can select their name from the list. 
   - If the attendee is not a member of your workspace, enter their full name or email address and press Enter on your keyboard to add them as a new attendee. 
4. Click **Save**.

Once added, you’ll also see the list of attendees in the expense overview on the Expenses tab. To see the cost per employee, hover over the receipt total. These details are also available on any report that you add the expense to.
