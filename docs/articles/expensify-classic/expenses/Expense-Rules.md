# Create an Expense Rule  

1. Hover over **Settings** and click **Account**.  
2. Click **Expense Rules**.  
3. Click **New Rule**.  
4. In the **Merchant Name Contains** field, enter part of the merchant name that should trigger the rule.  
   - **Note:** If you enter only a period (`.`), the rule applies to all expenses. Universal Rules take precedence over all other expense rules.  
5. Select the rules to apply when a matching expense is detected:  
   - **Merchant:** Standardizes the merchant name (e.g., "Starbucks #238" â†’ "Starbucks").  
   - **Category:** Assigns a workspace category to the expense.  
   - **Tag:** Adds a tag (e.g., Department or Location).  
   - **Description:** Updates the description field of the expense.  
   - **Reimbursability:** Marks the expense as reimbursable or non-reimbursable.  
   - **Billable:** Flags the expense as billable.  
   - **Add to a report named:** Assigns the expense to a specific report. If **Create report if necessary** is selected, a new one is created if the report does not exist.

# How Rules Are Applied  

Expense rules are processed from **top to bottom** in the list. However, other settings may override them. The rule hierarchy is:  

1. **Universal Rules** always override other expense category rules.  
2. **Scheduled Submit** with **Enforce Default Report Title** enabled takes precedence over expense rule-based report assignments.  
3. **Company Card Rules** for enforced workspaces take priority over individual expense rules.  
4. **Accounting Integrations** may override expense rule settings when expenses are exported.

# FAQ  

## How can I use expense rules for vendor matching in an accounting integration?  

When exporting non-reimbursable expenses, the **Payee** field in the accounting software will show "Credit Card Misc." if there is no exact match for the merchant name. This prevents multiple variations of the same vendor (e.g., "Starbucks" vs. "Starbucks #1234") from being created.  

To avoid this, use **Expense Rules** to standardize vendor names before export.  
- **Supported integrations:** QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, Xero.  
- **Not supported for:** NetSuite, Sage Intacct (due to API limitations).
