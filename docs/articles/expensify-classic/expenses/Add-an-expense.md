**What’s the difference between a reimbursable and non-reimbursable expense?**

- Reimbursable expenses are things that you pay for with your own money that the company has agreed to pay you back for (like business travel paid for with personal funds). 
- Non-reimbursable expenses are things you pay for with company money that need to be documented for accounting purposes (like a lunch paid for with a company card).

{% include info.html %}
If you are an employee under a company workspace, your expenses may automatically be configured as reimbursable or non-reimbursable depending on the details that are entered. If an expense is incorrectly labeled, you must reach out to an admin to have it corrected.
