When a travel receipt or itinerary is uploaded to Expensify via SmartScan, the Trips section of the mobile app automatically populates your trip information. If your flight has any cancellations, unexpected changes, or delays, we will notify you of them as soon as they occur via the mobile app. 

For the receipt to be processed as a Trip, it must include the total amount of the expense, date, and merchant name. 

If your company is using a travel integration from the list shown below, you can automate this process entirely:
- [TravelPerk](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/integrations/travel-integrations/TravelPerk)
- [Egencia](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/integrations/travel-integrations/Egencia)
- [Navan](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/connections/Navan)

# Add a Trip to your account

Trip receipts are typically sent via email and will include multiple pages. For ease, we recommend emailing receipts directly to Expensify. 

To email a flight or hotel receipt, simply forward the receipt from your Expensify-associated email address to receipts@expensify.com.

# Access your Trip information

To view details about your past or upcoming trips, follow these steps within the Expensify mobile app:
1. Open the Expensify mobile app
2. Navigate to the **Menu** option (top left â‰¡ icon)
3. Select **Trips**

## How do I capture Trip receipts sent to my personal email address?
If you received your receipt in an email that is not associated with your Expensify account, you can add this email as a [secondary login](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/settings/Change-or-add-email-address) to directly forward the receipt into your account.

## How do I upload Trip receipts that were not sent to me by email?
If your trip receipt was not sent to you by email, you can manually upload the receipt to your account. Check out this resource for more information on [manually creating expenses](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/expenses/Add-an-expense#add-an-expense-manually).
