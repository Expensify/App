When a travel receipt or itinerary is uploaded to Expensify via SmartScan, the **Trips** section of the mobile app automatically populates your trip details. If your flight has cancellations, unexpected changes, or delays, you’ll receive real-time notifications via the mobile app.

For the receipt to be processed as a **Trip**, it must include:
- **Total amount** of the expense
- **Date** of the expense
- **Merchant name**

If your company integrates with a travel service, you can automate this process entirely:

# FAQ

## How do I capture Trip receipts sent to my personal email?

## How do I upload Trip receipts that were not sent via email?
