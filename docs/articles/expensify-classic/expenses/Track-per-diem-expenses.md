A per diem (also called “per diem allowance” or “daily allowance”) is a fixed daily payment provided by an employer to cover expenses during business or work-related travel. These allowances simplify travel expense tracking and reimbursement for meals, lodging, and incidental expenses.

Before you can add a per diem expense, a Workspace Admin must enable per diem expenses for the workspace and add the per diem rates. If you do not see an option for per diem rates, it is currently unavailable for your workspace, and you’ll need to reach out to one of your Workspace Admins for guidance.

To add a per diem expense,

1. Click the **Expenses** tab.
