# Identify Expense Types
The right side of every report displays total expenses, broken down by **reimbursable**, **billable**, and **non-reimbursable** amounts.

## Reimbursable Expenses
Expenses paid by employees on behalf of the business, including:
- **Cash & Personal Card:** Out-of-pocket business expenses.
- **Per Diem:** Daily expense allowances configured in your [workspace settings](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Enable-per-diem-expenses).
- **Time:** Hourly wages for jobs, typically used for contractor invoicing. Configure rates [here](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Set-time-and-distance-rates).
- **Distance:** Mileage-related expenses.

## Non-Reimbursable Expenses
Expenses that are directly covered by the business, usually on company cards.

## Billable Expenses
Expenses billed to a client or vendor. Any expense—reimbursable or non-reimbursable—can also be billable.

# FAQ

## What’s the difference between an expense, a receipt, and a report attachment?
- **Expense:** Created when you SmartScan or manually upload a receipt.
- **Receipt:** Image file automatically attached to an expense via SmartScan.
- **Report Attachment:** Additional documents (e.g., supporting documents) added via the paperclip icon in report comments.

## How are credits or refunds displayed in Expensify?
Credits appear as **negative expenses** (e.g., -$1.00). They offset the total report amount.

For example:
- A report with **$400** and **$500** reimbursable expenses shows a total of **$900**.
- A report with **-$400** and **$500** expenses results in a **$100** total.
