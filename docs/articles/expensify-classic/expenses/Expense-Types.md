description: The difference between reimbursable, non-reimbursable, and billable expenses
---

Expensify groups expenses into three expense types: reimbursable, non-reimbursable, and billable. When you manually create a new expense, you'll select the expense type. You can also see a breakdown of these expense types on your report and can even organize the report by them. 

- **Reimbursable expenses**: Expenses paid to the employee, including:
    - **Cash & personal card**: Expenses paid for by the employee on behalf of the business.
    - **Per diem**: Expenses for a daily or partial daily rate [configured in your Workspace](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Enable-per-diem-expenses).
    - **Time**: An hourly rate for your employees or jobs as [set for your workspace](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Set-time-and-distance-rates). This expense type is usually used by contractors or small businesses billing the customer via [Expensify Invoicing](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Set-Up-Invoicing).
    - **Distance**: Expenses related to business travel.
- **Non-reimbursable expenses**: Expenses directly covered by the business, typically on company cards.
- **Billable expenses**: Business or employee expenses that must be billed to a specific client or vendor. This option is for tracking expenses for invoicing to customers, clients, or other departments. Any kind of expense can be billable in _addition_ to being either reimbursable or non-reimbursable.

# Organize a Report by Expense Type

Organizing a report by expense type can make it easier to review expenses on a report.

**Whatâ€™s the difference between an expense, a receipt, and a report attachment?**

- **Expense:** When you SmartScan or manually upload a receipt from a purchase, this creates an expense for the purchase that you can track in Expensify. 
- **Receipt:** A picture file that is automatically attached to the expense during the SmartScan process.
- **Report Attachments:** Additional documents that need to be submitted to your approver (i.e., supplemental documents to the purchase). These can be added to a report any time by clicking the paperclip icon in the comments section at the bottom of the report.

**How are credits or refunds displayed in Expensify?**

In Expensify, a credit is displayed as an expense with a minus in front of it (e.g., -$1.00). Expensify defaults all expenses as something that needs to be paid by the company. So a credit that is returned to the company is displayed as a negative expense.
