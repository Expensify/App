---

The Expenses page allows you to see all of your personal expenses. If you are an admin, you can also view all expenses submitted by people in your Workspace. You can use this page to filter, report, code, and export expenses. 

## Filter Expenses

Expenses can be filtered in several ways to give you spending visibility, help you find expenses to submit, and customize your .csv export.

1. Click the **Expenses** tab.
2. Adjust any of the following filters at the top of the page to match your specific needs:
   - **Date Range:** Find expenses within a specific time frame.
   - **Merchant Name:** Search for expenses from a particular merchant. Partial search terms work as well.
   - **Workspace:** Locate specific Group/Individual Workspace expenses.
   - **Categories:** Group expenses by category or identify those without a category.
   - **Tags:** Filter expenses with specific tags.
   - **Submitters:** Filter expenses by submitter (employee or vendor).
   - **Personal Expenses:** Find all expenses yet to be included in a report. A Workspace admin can see these expenses once they are on a Processing, Approved, or Reimbursed report.
   - **Open:** Display expenses on reports that have not yet been submitted.
   - **Processing, Approved, Reimbursed:** See expenses on reports that are in the processing, approved, or reimbursed stages.
   - **Closed:** View expenses on closed reports (not submitted for approval).

*Note: You might notice that not all expense filters are always visible. They adapt based on the data you're currently filtering and persist from the last time you logged in. For instance, you won't see the Deleted filter if there are no **Deleted** expenses to filter out. Additionally, if you are not seeing what you expected, you may have too many filters applied. Click **Reset** at the top to clear your filters.* 

# Add an expense to a report

The submitter (and their copilot) can add expenses to a report from the Expenses page. *Note: When expenses aren’t on a report, they are **personal expenses**. You’ll want to make sure you haven’t filtered out **personal expenses**, or you won’t be able to see them.* 

1. Find and select the expense(s) you want to add to the report by selecting the checkbox to the left. Or you can click **Select All**.
2. Click **Add to Report** in the upper right corner. Then choose an existing report or create a new one.

# Code expenses

To code expenses from the Expenses page, 

1. Look for the **Tag**, **Category**, and **Description** columns on the **Expenses** page.
2. Click the relevant field for a specific expense and add or update the **Category**, **Tag**, or **Description**. 

*Note: You can also open up individual expenses by clicking on them to see a detailed look.*

# Export expenses to a CSV file

To export multiple expenses, 

1. Select the expenses you want to export by selecting the checkbox to the left of each expense.
2. Click **Export To** in the upper right corner of the page and choose the default CSV format or create your own custom CSV template.

**As a Workspace admin, what submitter expenses can you see?**

A Workspace admin can see Processing, Approved, and Reimbursed expenses as long as they were submitted on the workspace that you are an admin. 

If employees submit expense reports on a Workspace where you are not an admin, you will not have visibility into those expenses. Additionally, if an expense is left unreported, a Workspace admin will not be able to see that expense until it’s been added to a report.

A Workspace admin can edit the tags and categories on an expense, but if they want to edit the amount, date, or merchant name, the expense will need to be in a Processing state or rejected back to the submitter for changes.

**Can I edit multiple expenses at once?**

Yes! Select the expenses you want to edit and click **Edit Multiple**.
