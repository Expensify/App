## Diagnosing Issues Using Receipt Images

If your **credit card expenses** are missing or incorrect, check for an **attached receipt**:

- **SmartScanned receipts** should be attached to most imported expenses.
- If your **admin allows eReceipts** (US only), low-value expenses may include an **eReceipt** instead of a traditional receipt.
- eReceipts will show the **locked credit card icon** along with a **QR code** for verification.

If an expected receipt is missing, try manually attaching it or checking with your admin for eReceipt settings.

# FAQ

## Why canâ€™t I edit my expense amount?

- Company card expenses have fixed amounts from imported transactions.
- Approved expenses cannot be edited unless reopened.

## Why donâ€™t I see an expense type?
Your workspace settings may restrict available expense types.

## Can I move expenses between reports?

- Yes, but only for expenses that are still open and not yet submitted.

## How do I edit per diem expenses?
Per diem expenses **cannot** be edited. Delete and recreate the expense if needed.

## Why didnâ€™t my expenses merge automatically?
- Receipts were not SmartScanned.
- Dates or amounts differ.
- Expenses are in different user accounts.
- Expenses were already submitted or reimbursed.

Use manual merging for unmerged expenses.

## Can Expensify automatically merge a cash expense with a credit card expense?

Yes, when a card expense is imported that matches the date and amount for a SmartScanned expense, Expensify automatically merges the new expense into the existing SmartScanned expense, and the expense will now show a credit card icon. The same is true if a receipt is SmartScanned and the transaction has already been importedâ€”it will merge as soon as the SmartScan is complete.

When expenses merge automatically, Expensify uses the SmartScanned merchant name over the merchant data from the bank statement. If the SmartScan is stopped, Expensify can no longer guarantee that the data entry is accurate, so the expenses will not merge.

**Note:** Expenses created via the Expensify [Expense Importer API](https://integrations.expensify.com/Integration-Server/doc/#expense-creator) will not automatically merge with card feed transactions.
