description: Add tags, categories, and descriptions to expenses

<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

You can code expenses in Expensify by adding tags, categories, or descriptions. 

The first step is for a Workspace Admin to create tags or create categories for your workspace. You can then add them to an expense when you add a new expense to Expensify (which may be required by some workspaces), or you can add them after the expense has been created (if they are not required by the workspace). 

To code expenses for a workspace that does not require tags and/or categories,

1. Click the **Expenses** tab.
2. Add a tag, category, or description to an expense by either:
   - Clicking the field under a column of an expense to add it. For example, to add a description, locate an expense and click the field under the description column to add one.
   - Clicking an expense to open it. For example, to add a description, you can click an expense to open it and add details into the Description field. Then click **Save**.
  
{% include info.html %}
Your tags column/field may say "Tag" or it may have a different name. For example, you may have a tag called Location, Department, Project, etc., and you may have multiple tag columns/fields. 
{% include end-info.html %}
