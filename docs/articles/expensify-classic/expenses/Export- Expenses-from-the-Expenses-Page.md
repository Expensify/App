# Filter Expenses for Export

Before exporting expenses, use filters to narrow down the data:
1. Click the **Expenses** tab.
2. Adjust the filters at the top of the page:
   - **Date Range** – Select a specific time frame.
   - **Merchant Name** – Find expenses from a particular vendor (partial searches work).
   - **Workspace** – View expenses for a specific Group or Individual Workspace.
   - **Categories** – Filter by category to refine your search.
   - **Tags** – Locate expenses based on assigned tags.
   - **Submitters** – Find expenses by employee or vendor.
   - **Personal Expenses** – Show expenses that have not yet been added to a report.
   - **Open, Processing, Approved, Reimbursed, Closed** – View expenses at different reporting stages.

**Note:** Some filters adjust dynamically based on your current selections. If results aren’t as expected, click **Reset** to clear all filters.

# FAQ

## Can I edit multiple expenses before exporting?

Yes! Select multiple expenses and click **Edit Multiple** to make bulk changes before exporting.

## What submitter expenses can a Workspace Admin see?

A Workspace admin can view **Processing, Approved, and Reimbursed** expenses if they were submitted under the Workspace they manage. Unreported expenses remain invisible until added to a report.

Admins can edit **tags** and **categories** but must reject expenses or have them in **Processing** to modify the amount, date, or merchant name.
