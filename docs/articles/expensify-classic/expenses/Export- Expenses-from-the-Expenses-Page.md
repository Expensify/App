# Filter Expenses for Export

Before exporting expenses, use filters to refine your search:

1. Click the **Expenses** tab.
2. Adjust the filters at the top of the page:
   - **Date Range** – Select a specific time frame.
   - **Merchant Name** – Find expenses from a particular vendor (partial searches work).
   - **Workspace** – View expenses for a specific Group or Individual Workspace.
   - **Categories** – Filter by category to refine your search.
   - **Tags** – Locate expenses based on assigned tags.
   - **Submitters** – Find expenses by employee or vendor.
   - **Personal Expenses** – Show expenses that have not yet been added to a report.
   - **Open, Processing, Approved, Reimbursed, Closed** – View expenses at different reporting stages.

**Note:** Some filters adjust dynamically based on your current selections. If results aren’t as expected, click **Reset** to clear all filters.

**Mobile Users:** The Expensify Classic mobile app does not include a search bar or filters in the **Expenses** tab. To find an expense, you must manually scroll through the list, which is ordered chronologically with the most recent at the top.

# FAQ

## Can I edit multiple expenses before exporting?

Yes! Select multiple expenses and click **Edit Multiple** to make bulk changes before exporting.

## What submitter expenses can a Workspace Admin see?

A Workspace admin can view **Processing, Approved, and Reimbursed** expenses if they were submitted under the Workspace they manage. Unreported expenses remain invisible until added to a report.

Admins can edit **tags** and **categories**, but must reject expenses or have them in **Processing** to modify the amount, date, or merchant name. For company card reconciliation, refer to [this article](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-credit-cards/company-cards/Reconciliation).

## Can I search for expenses in the mobile app?

No, the Expensify Classic mobile app does not have a search bar or filters in the **Expenses** tab. You must scroll through your expenses manually, which are listed in chronological order with the most recent at the top. For advanced filtering and search options, use the web version of Expensify on your desktop. New Expensify does offer some filtering which you can learn about [here](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/getting-started/Using-Reports-in-New-Expensify).
