# Expense Editing Rules

Editing restrictions apply based on expense type and report status.

## General Editing Rules
- **Category, description, attendees, and report assignment** can be edited by the expense owner, approvers, and Workspace Admins.
- **Amount** can be edited for most manually entered expenses, except for company card transactions.
- **Tag and billable status** can be updated as long as the report is editable.

## Company Card Expenses
- **Amount cannot be edited** for expenses imported from a company card.
- **Category, tag, and billable status** can be edited if the report is Open or Processing.
- **Receipt images** can be added or replaced at any time.

## Submitted and Approved Expenses
- **Submitted expenses** can only be edited by an approver or Workspace Admin.
- **Approved expenses** cannot be edited unless reopened (also called unapproved).
- **Expenses in a Closed report** cannot be edited.

## Description and Workspace Violations
- If an expense has a violation but includes a **description or comment**, it will still be submitted via Scheduled Submit.
- The **description acts as the user‚Äôs explanation** for why the violation wasn‚Äôt resolved.
- This allows the report to move forward while providing visibility for approvers or Workspace Admins.

**Note:** The violation will still appear but will not block submission if a comment or explanation is provided.

## Expense Icons
**Each expense has an icon showing how it was created:**
- üè¶ **Cash Icon**: Manually added or SmartScanned
- üí≥ **Credit Card Icon**: Imported from a personal card
- üìÑ **Spreadsheet Icon**: Imported via CSV
- üîí **Locked Credit Card Icon**: Imported from a company card feed or company CSV

# FAQ

## Who can edit an expense?
- **Expense owner**: Can edit expenses if the report is Open.
- **Approvers and Workspace Admins**: Can edit submitted expenses before final approval.
- **Finance teams** might have additional permissions based on workspace settings.

## Why can't I edit my expense amount?
Company card expenses have a fixed amount based on imported transaction data and cannot be changed.

## Can I edit an expense after it has been approved?
No, approved expenses cannot be edited unless the report is reopened (unapproved).

If you need to edit an expense on a submitted report, you can contact an approver or Workspace Admin to reopen (un-approve) the report.

## Can I undo a split expense?
No, it can't be undone once an expense is split and saved. If you want to start over, delete the split expenses and re-upload the receipt.

## Will each split have the same receipt image?
Yes. The same image will appear on all the split expenses for easy reference and audit compliance.

## Can I apply different categories or tags to each split?
Absolutely! That's one of the main benefits of splitting an expense ‚Äî you can customize each part individually.

## Can Expensify automatically merge a cash expense with a credit card expense?

Yes! When a SmartScanned receipt matches an imported credit card transaction by date and amount, Expensify merges them automatically.

- If the SmartScan comes first, the card import will merge.
- If the card transaction comes first, the SmartScan will merge once complete.
- Expensify uses the SmartScanned merchant name over the one from the card feed.

**Merging won't happen automatically:**
- If you manually stop SmartScan.
- If the expenses were created via the [Expense Importer API](https://integrations.expensify.com/Integration-Server/doc/#expense-creator).

## Why didn‚Äôt my expenses merge automatically?

**Here are some common reasons:**
- The cash receipt was not SmartScanned.
- The transaction dates are different.
- Amounts differ (in the same currency).
- Amounts exceed a 5% difference in foreign exchange (FX) rates.
- The transaction is over 90 days old.
- One of the duplicates already merged with a third entry.
- The cash expense was already submitted, reimbursed, or exported before the card import.
- The card and receipt are in different Expensify accounts.

You can still merge expenses manually if both are **Unreported** or **Open** and exist in the same account.
