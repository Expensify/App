A workspace is the set of rules, settings, and spending limits used for expense reports in your organization. This includes custom expense categories and tags, budgets, currency, tax settings, approval workflows, and accounting connections.

Here are a few examples of when you’d create different workspaces:
- Employees submit reports in different currencies (e.g., USD vs. CAD).
- Different departments need custom coding options, like Sales vs. Support.

# Navigating Multiple Workspaces

If you have multiple workspaces (whether an individual workspace and a group workspace or multiple group workspaces), you’ll want to ensure employees set a default workspace before creating an expense report to ensure it’s posted to the correct workspace.

## To Set Default Workspace:
1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Workspaces**.
2. To the right of the desired workspace, click **Make Default**.

## Ensure Employees Select the Correct Workspace

As an admin, it’s important to ensure employees are submitting expenses and reports to the correct workspace. Instruct your team to check their selected workspace before adding expenses or creating reports.

- Employees should click their profile image.
- From the dropdown menu, they must select the correct workspace from the list at the bottom.
- If an employee frequently switches between workspaces, remind them to always verify the workspace selection before submitting an expense or report.

By reinforcing this process, you help prevent expense reports from being mis-categorized and ensure accurate financial tracking.
