## Using SmartScan on the App
### Capture receipts
1. Open the Expensify mobile app. 
2. Tap the green camera button to take a photo of a receipt.

### SmartScan analysis 
After capturing or uploading a receipt, Expensify's SmartScan technology goes to work. It analyzes the receipt to extract key details such as the merchant's name, transaction date, transaction currency, and total amount spent. SmartScan inputs all the data for you, so you don’t have to type a thing.
### Review and edit 
Once SmartScan is finished, you  can further categorize and code your expense based on your company’s policy. Review this data to ensure accuracy. If necessary, you can edit or add additional details, such as expense categories, tags, attendees, tax rates, or descriptions.
### Multi-Currency support
For businesses dealing with international expenses, SmartScan can handle multiple currencies and provide accurate exchange rate conversion based on your policies reporting currency. It's essential to set up and configure currency preferences for these scenarios.
### Custom expense categories 
SmartScan can automatically categorize expenses based on vendor or merchant. Users can customize these categories to suit their specific accounting needs. This can be particularly useful for tracking expenses across different departments or projects.
### SmartScan outcomes
SmartScan's performance can vary depending on factors such as receipt quality, language, and handwriting. It's important to keep the following variables in mind:
**Receipt quality**: The clarity and condition of a receipt can impact SmartScan's accuracy. For best results, ensure your environment is well-lit and the receipt is straight and free of obstructions.
**Language support**: While SmartScan supports multiple languages, its accuracy may differ from one language to another. Users dealing with non-English receipts should be aware of potential variations in data extraction.
**Handwriting recognition**: Handwritten receipts might pose challenges for SmartScan. In such cases, manual verification may be necessary to ensure accurate data entry.
