#  Overview
If you're an individual using Expensify, the Track and Submit plans are designed to assist self-employed users in effectively managing both their personal and business finances.

# How to use the Track plan

The Track plan is tailored for solo Expensify users who don't require expense submission to others. Individuals or sole proprietors can choose the Track plan to customize their Individual Workspace to align with their personal expense tracking requirements.

You can select the Track plan from the Workspace settings. Navigate to **Settings > Workspace > Individual > *[Workspace Name]* > Plan** to select Track. 
You can also do this from the Pricing page at https://www.expensify.com/pricing.

The Track plan includes a predefined set of categories designed to align with IRS Schedule C expense categories. However, you have the flexibility to add extra categories as needed. For a more detailed breakdown, you can also set up tags to create another layer of coding.

The Track plan offers 25 free SmartScans per month. If you require more than 25 SmartScans, you can upgrade to a Monthly Individual subscription at a cost of $4.99 USD per month.

# How to use the Submit plan
The Submit plan is designed for individuals who need to keep track of their expenses and share them with someone else, such as their boss, accountant, or even a housemate. It's specifically tailored for single users who want to both track and submit their expenses efficiently.

You can select the Track plan from the Workspace settings. Navigate to **Settings > Workspaces > Individual > *[Workspace Name]* > Plan** to select "Submit" or from the Pricing page at https://www.expensify.com/pricing.

You will select who your expenses get sent to under **Settings > Workspace > Individual > *[Workspace Name]* > Reports**. If the recipient already has an Expensify account, they'll be able to see the report directly in the Expensify app. Otherwise, non-Expensify users will receive a PDF copy of the report attached to the email so it can be processed.
