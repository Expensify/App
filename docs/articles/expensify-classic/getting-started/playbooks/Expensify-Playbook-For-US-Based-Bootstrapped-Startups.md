This playbook details best practices on how Bootstrapped Startups with less than 5 employees can use Expensify to prioritize product development while capturing business-related receipts for future reimbursement.
- See our *[Playbook for VC-Backed Startups](https://help.expensify.com/articles/playbooks/Expensify-Playbook-for-US-based-VC-Backed-Startups)* if you have taken venture capital investment and are more concerned with prioritizing top-line revenue growth than achieving near-term profitability
- See our *[Playbook for Small to Medium-Sized Businesses](https://help.expensify.com/articles/playbooks/Expensify-Playbook-for-Small-to-Medium-Sized-Businesses)* if you are more concerned with maintaining profitability than growing top-line revenue.

# Who you are
As a bootstrapped startup, you have surrounded yourself with a small handful of people you trust, and are focused on developing your concept to officially launch and possibly take to outside investors. You are likely running your business with your own money, and possibly a small amount of funding from friends and family. You are either paying yourself a little, or not at all, but at this stage, the company isn’t profitable. And for now, you are capturing receipts so that you can reimburse yourself for startup costs when you either take on investment or start to turn a profit.

# Step-by-step instructions for setting up Expensify
This playbook is built based on best practices we’ve developed after processing expenses for tens of thousands of companies around the world. As such, use this playbook as your starting point, knowing that you can customize Expensify to suit your business needs. Every company is different, and we’re always one chat away with any questions you may have.

## Step 1: Create your Expensify account
If you don't already have one, go to *[new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com)* and sign up for an account with your work email address.

## Step 2: Create a Workspace
There are two plans: Collect and Control. We outline the features of both plans in our [pricing article](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/billing-and-subscriptions/Plan-types-and-pricing), but for your needs, we recommend the Collect workspace for the following reasons:

- You are looking to capture receipts, but you don’t need an advanced approval workflow, instead you can have a single approver for all expenses. 
- You are a small, highly collaborative group and project-oriented Chat functionality can help you stay organized.
- When your business produces enough cash that you can pay yourself, you might want to reimburse yourself for the expenses you’ve captured.

Expensify provides you with direct access to lightning-fast 24/7 support via Concierge. Within *[new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com/concierge)*, you can start a direct message (DM) with Concierge to discuss which plan might be better for your business. 

## Step 3: Invite Your Team
As a bootstrapped startup, you communicate with your team all day. Similarly, if you are a co-founder, you will have multiple people who will need to capture receipts for your project.

1. Click your profile photo or icon in the bottom left menu
2. Select *Workspaces*
4. Click on your workspace
5. From the workspace view, click **Members** on the left
6. Click **Invite member**
7. Use the search field to find the individual by name, email, or phone number. Note: You can select multiple people
8. Click **Next**
9. (Optional) Enter a custom message into the Message field
10. Click **Invite**

By inviting your team, all members of your team will have access to unlimited receipt capture via SmartScan, and you’ll all have access to our free chat tool, which makes it easy to chat about your project and the expenses you’ve captured to help accelerate your project.

## Step 4: Link Your Business Bank Account (Optional)
If you are located in the US, you can unlock many great features by linking your US-based business bank account such as using the [Expensify Visa® Commercial Card](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expensify-card/Set-up-the-Expensify-Card) to streamline expense management and receive additional discounts and company perks. 

To setup a business bank account, follow the steps in this [help article](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expenses-&-payments/Connect-a-Business-Bank-Account). 

## Step 5: Get the Expensify Card
If you linked your business bank account in the previous step, you are immediately eligible for the Expensify Card. The Expensify Card earns you 1% cash back on all US purchases (2% if you spend $250k+/mo across cards), and they are all stored in your team’s workspace. It’s easy to apply, and it takes minutes!

To setup the Expensify Card in your workspace, follow the steps in this [help article](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expensify-card/Set-up-the-Expensify-Card). 

You’ll be issued a virtual card that you can use immediately, and in 1-3 business days, your Expensify Card will arrive. You can use the Expensify Card anywhere Visa is accepted.

In addition to physical and virtual cards, you can issue Unlimited Virtual Cards with a fixed or monthly limit for specific company purchases (ex., Marketing purchases, Advertising, Travel, etc).

## Step 6: View and Pay Bills
Whether it’s online services or vendors you work with to grow your project, you likely have bills to pay. And now that you have your business bank account linked, you can easily pay bills directly from Expensify. Seeing as these are project-related expenses, we’ll capture them for you for future reference directly within your project’s workspace.

There’s no actual setup required. Your free plan comes with a _yourdomain.com@expensify.com_ email address. Just have all of your vendors send bills to that email address.

To view and pay bills:

1. Click your profile photo or icon in the bottom left menu
2. Select *Workspaces*.
3. Click on your workspace
4. Select *Bills*

When you have bills to pay you can click *View all bills* under the *Manage your bills* box and we’ll keep a neatly organized list of all of the bills you can pay via ACH directly from your Expensify account.
