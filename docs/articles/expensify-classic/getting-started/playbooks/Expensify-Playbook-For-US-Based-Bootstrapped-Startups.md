This playbook outlines best practices for bootstrapped startups with fewer than five employees to use Expensify efficiently. The goal is to focus on product development while seamlessly capturing business-related receipts for future reimbursement.

- If you've secured venture capital and are prioritizing top-line revenue growth, see our [Playbook for VC-Backed Startups](https://help.expensify.com/articles/playbooks/Expensify-Playbook-for-US-based-VC-Backed-Startups).
- If maintaining profitability is your primary concern, check out our *[Playbook for Small to Medium-Sized Businesses](https://help.expensify.com/articles/playbooks/Expensify-Playbook-for-Small-to-Medium-Sized-Businesses).

# Who You Are
As a bootstrapped startup, you work with a small, trusted team and are focused on developing your concept. You may be self-funding or have limited support from friends and family. While the company isn’t profitable yet, you’re tracking expenses now to reimburse yourself later when you secure investment or generate revenue.

# Setting Up Expensify Step-by-Step
This guide is based on best practices from processing expenses for thousands of companies. Use it as a starting point, knowing you can customize Expensify to fit your business needs.

# Step 1: Create a Workspace
Expensify offers three plans (Individual, Collect, and Control). We outline the features of both plans in our [pricing article](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/billing-and-subscriptions/Plan-types-and-pricing), but for your needs, we recommend the Collect workspace for the following situations:

- You want to capture receipts, but you don’t need an advanced approval workflow. Instead, you can have a single approver for all expenses. 
- You are a small, highly collaborative group, and project-oriented Chat functionality can help you stay organized.
- When your business produces enough cash that you can pay yourself, you might want to reimburse yourself for the expenses you’ve incurred.

Expensify provides you with direct access to lightning-fast 24/7 support via Concierge. Within *[new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com/concierge)*, you can start a direct message (DM) with Concierge to discuss which plan might be better for your business. 

# Step 2: Invite Your Team
As a bootstrapped startup, you communicate with your team all day. Similarly, if you are a co-founder, you will have multiple people who will need to capture receipts for your project.

1. From the left-side navigation menu, click **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members**
4. Click **Invite member**
5. Use the search field to find the individual by name, email, or phone number. Note: You can select multiple people
6. Click **Next**
7. (Optional) Enter a custom message into the Message field
8. Click **Invite**

Inviting your team grants them unlimited receipt capture via SmartScan and access to Expensify’s free chat tool for seamless collaboration.

# Step 3: Link Your Business Bank Account (Optional)

If you are located in the US, you can unlock many great features by linking your US-based business bank account. For example, you can use the [Expensify Visa® Commercial Card](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expensify-card/Set-up-the-Expensify-Card) to streamline expense management and receive additional discounts and company perks. 

To set up a business bank account, follow the steps in this [help article](https://help.expensify.com/articles/new-expensify/expenses-&-payments/Connect-a-Business-Bank-Account).

# Step 4: Get the Expensify Visa® Commercial Card
After linking your business bank account, you’re eligible for the Expensify Card. The card offers:

- **1% cash back** on all US purchases (2% if spending exceeds $250K/month).
- **Unlimited virtual cards** with fixed or monthly limits for specific company purchases (e.g., marketing, advertising, travel).
- **Fast access** to funds via a virtual card while waiting for a physical card.

To enable the Expensify Card:

1. Click your **avatar**.
2. Select **Workspaces**.
3. Click your workspace.
4. Select **Cards**.
5. You’ll be redirected to expensify.com.
6. Set a SmartLimit above $0.
7. Enter your mailing address for a physical card.
