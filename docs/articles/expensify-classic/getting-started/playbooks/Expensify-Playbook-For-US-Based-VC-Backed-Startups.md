This playbook outlines best practices for Seed to Series A startups with fewer than 100 employees, helping them leverage Expensify to scale efficiently while maintaining financial control.

# Who You Are
As a VC-backed startup focused on growth and efficiency, you need a solution that automates financial operations while ensuring compliance. You prioritize top-line revenue growth over cost-cutting, recognizing that controlled spending fuels expansion. You want to empower employees with spending autonomy while maintaining oversight and minimizing manual finance tasks like reimbursements and reconciliations.

# Step-by-Step Expensify Setup
This guide is based on best practices from thousands of companies using Expensify. Customize it as needed, and reach out via chat for additional support.

## Step 1: Create an Expensify Account
If you don’t already have an account, visit [new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com) and sign up using your work email. Expensify accounts are free to create.

## Step 2: Upgrade to a Paid Workspace
Expensify offers three workspace plans: **Individual, Collect, and Control**. We recommend **Control** for VC-backed startups because it provides:
- Spending caps and compliance controls via Concierge Audit Tracking.
- Scalable approval workflows as your team grows (see Step 8).

### To create a Control workspace:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Workspaces**.
2. Select **Group** and click **New Workspace**.
3. Click **Select** under **Control**.

The **Control** plan is bundled with the Expensify Visa® Commercial Card and costs $9/user per month (annual commitment). You’ll also be assigned a **Setup Specialist**, available in your workspace’s #admins chat room on *[new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com)*.

## Step 3: Connect Your Accounting System
Proper financial management is key for VC-backed companies. Ensure that:
- Every purchase is categorized correctly in your chart of accounts.
- Expenses sync automatically with your accounting software.

### To connect your accounting system:
1. Go to Settings > Workspaces.
2. Click the **Connections** tab.
3. Select your accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero).
4. Follow the prompts to complete the connection.
5. Once connected, your categories will sync, allowing you to set **Category Rules**.

## Step 4: Set Up Category Rules
Category rules help control spending and ensure compliance. We recommend:
1. Go to Settings > Workspaces.
2. Open the **Categories** tab.
3. Click **Edit Rules** for a category.
4. Configure rules such as:
   - **$75 daily limit** for meals and entertainment.
   - Require **scanned receipts** for:
     - Purchases over $1,000.
     - Lodging, meals over $50/person, office supplies, software, and airfare.
   - Require **expense descriptions** for airfare and rideshare/taxi expenses.

## Step 5: Enable Scheduled Submit
For efficiency, enable **Scheduled Submit** on a **Daily** frequency:
1. Go to Settings > Workspaces.
2. Select your **Control** workspace.
3. Click the **Reports** tab.
4. Under **Report Basics**, set **Scheduled Submit** to **Daily**.

This ensures automatic expense submission while flagging exceptions for manual review.

## Step 6: Connect a Business Bank Account
To use Expensify’s payment and reimbursement features, link your bank account:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Account > Payments**.
2. Click **Add Verified Bank Account**.
3. Provide your banking credentials and business details.

Once verified, you can reimburse expenses, issue Expensify Cards, and process invoice payments.

## Step 7: Invite Employees
Invite employees to your workspace via:
- **Unique Workspace Link** (found in Settings > Workspaces > Members).
- **Manual entry** (enter emails and click **Invite**).
- **Google SSO sync** (if using Google Workspace).

## Step 8: Set Up Approval Workflows
Define an approval process to manage expenses efficiently:
1. Go to Settings > Workspaces > Members.
2. Click Submit & Approve to set yourself as the approver.
3. Enable **manual approval** for expenses over **$1,000**.
4. Turn on **Workflow Enforcement** to ensure employees submit expenses correctly.

## Step 9: Assign Corporate Cards
Expensify supports direct card feeds from most banks, but using the **Expensify Card** is recommended.

### If using your own corporate card:
1. Go to Settings > Domains > Company Cards.
2. Select your bank and enter credentials.
3. Assign corporate cards to employees.

### If using the Expensify Card:
1. Apply via Inbox* or *Settings > Domains > Company Cards.
2. Assign physical and virtual cards to employees.
3. Set **SmartLimits**:
   - $1,000 for employees.
   - $10,000 for executives.
   - Unlimited Virtual Cards for specific business expenses.

The Expensify Card enables **real-time compliance monitoring** and auto-reconciliation.

## Step 10: Set Up Bill Pay & Invoicing
Expensify simplifies vendor payments and invoicing.

### To pay bills:
1. Have vendors email invoices to *yourdomain@expensify.cash*.
2. Review the bill in Expensify.
3. Click **Pay** and choose ACH, card, or check.

### To send invoices:
1. Go to Reports > New Report > Invoice.
2. Add billable expenses and a recipient email.
3. Click **Send**.

## Step 11: Add a Billing Card
Ensure uninterrupted service by adding a billing card:
1. Go to Account > Settings > Payments.
2. Click Add Payment Card.
3. Enter your card details and click *Accept Terms*.
