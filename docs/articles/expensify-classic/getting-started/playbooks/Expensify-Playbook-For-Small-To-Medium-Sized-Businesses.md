# Step 1: Create Your Expensify Account

If you don’t already have an account, sign up at [new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com) using your work email. 

> *Employees really appreciate how easy it is to use, and the fact that the reimbursement drops right into their bank account. Since most employees are submitting expenses from their phones, the ease of use of the app is critical.*
