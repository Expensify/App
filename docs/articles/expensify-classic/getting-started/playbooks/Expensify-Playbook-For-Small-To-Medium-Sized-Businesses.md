# Expensify Playbook for Small to Medium-Sized Businesses

Expensify helps small to medium-sized businesses (100-250 employees) streamline expense management, increase compliance, and simplify reimbursements. This guide outlines best practices to optimize your workflow.

## Who You Are
As a small business owner, your goal is to grow your company while maintaining financial control. By implementing Expensify, you can:

- Equip employees with an easy-to-use expense reporting system.
- Ensure compliance with company spending policies.
- Improve visibility and control over expenses.

## Setting Up Expensify: Step-by-Step
This playbook is built on best practices from thousands of businesses worldwide. Use it as a starting point and customize Expensify to meet your needs.

## Step 1: Create Your Expensify Account
If you don’t already have an account, sign up at [new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com) using your work email. It’s free to create an account.

> *Employees really appreciate how easy it is to use, and the fact that the reimbursement drops right into their bank account. Since most employees are submitting expenses from their phones, the ease of use of the app is critical.*

## Step 2: Create a Control Workspace
For small businesses, we recommend the **Control Plan** because:

- It supports high-volume expense submissions.
- It enforces compliance controls.
- It integrates with QuickBooks Online, Xero, NetSuite, and Sage Intacct.

### How to Set Up a Control Workspace
1. Go to Settings > Workspace.
2. Select **Group** and click **New Workspace**.
3. Click **Select** under **Control**.

Control Plan users also receive a **Setup Specialist** to assist with onboarding. Find yours in *[new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com)* under your workspace’s **#admins** room.

## Step 3: Connect Your Accounting System
Sync Expensify with your accounting software for real-time financial tracking:

1. Navigate to Settings > Workspace > Connections.
2. Select your accounting system and follow the setup prompts.

## Step 4: Set Category-Specific Compliance Controls

4. Disable irrelevant expense categories.
5. Configure **Auto-Categorization** for imported card transactions.

## Step 5: Require or Set Default Tags
- **Require Tags:** In the **Tags** tab, enable the “Required” field to flag uncategorized expenses.
- **Set Employee Default Tags:** If using NetSuite or Sage Intacct, auto-assign employee departments to expenses.

## Step 6: Establish Global Compliance Rules
Set workspace-wide compliance policies in *Expenses > Violations*:

- **Max Expense Age:** 90 days (or leave blank).
- **Max Expense Amount:** $2,000 (or leave blank).

2. Select **Add Verified Bank Account** and follow the prompts.

## Step 9: Invite Employees and Set Approval Workflows
- **Select an Approval Mode:** We recommend **Advanced Approval**.

- **Manually Approve Reports:** Ensure expense coding accuracy.

## Step 10: Configure Auto-Approval
1. Navigate to Settings > Workspace > Reimbursement.
2. Set **Manual Reimbursement Threshold*** to **$20,000**.

## Step 11: Enable Domain Control and Corporate Cards
### If You Have a Corporate Card

2. Enter **master admin credentials**.
3. Assign cards to employees.

### If You Don’t Have a Corporate Card
