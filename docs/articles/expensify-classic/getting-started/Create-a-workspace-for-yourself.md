# Overview

Welcome to Expensify! If you are a freelancer or tracking your personal expenses, follow the steps below to get started.

# 1. Download the mobile app

Upload your expenses and check your reports right from your phone by downloading the Expensify mobile app. You can search for “Expensify” in the app store, or tap one of the links below. 

[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expensify-expense-tracker/id471713959) 
| [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.me.mobiexpensifyg&hl=en_US&gl=US)

# 2. Meet Concierge

Your personal assistant, Concierge, lives on your Expensify Home page on both desktop and the mobile app.

Concierge will walk you through setting up your account and also provide:
- Reminders to do things like submit your expenses
- Alerts when more information is needed on an expense report
- Updates on new and improved account features 

You can also get support at any time by clicking the green chat bubble in the right corner. This will open a chat with Concierge where you can ask questions and receive direct support.
 
# 3. Create a workspace

All Expensify accounts automatically come with an individual workspace already set up. You can use this space for your personal expenses, or you can create a group workspace—even if you will be the only person in the group. 

Here’s how to determine whether a personal or group workspace might be best for you:
- A *personal workspace* is a private workspace just for you. 
- A *group workspace* allows you to use the workspace individually or add additional members. You can also create expense approval flows and connect accounting, HR, and travel integrations.

## Set up your individual workspace

<ol type="a">
   <li>Hover over Settings, then click <b>Workspaces</b>.</li>
   <li>Click the <b>Individual</b> tab on the left.</li>
   <li>Select the policy type that best fits your needs.</li>
   <li>Set up your workspace details including the workspace name, expense rules, categories, and more.</li>
</ol>

## Create a group workspace

<ol type="a">
   <li>Hover over Settings, then click <b>Workspaces</b>.</li>
   <li>Click the <b>Group</b> tab on the left.</li>
   <li>Click <b>New Workspace</b>.</li>
   <li>Set up your workspace details including the workspace name, expense rules, categories, and more.</li>
</ol>

# 4. Add an expense 

You can create an expense automatically by SmartScanning a receipt, or you can enter them manually. 

## SmartScan a receipt

You can upload pictures of your receipts to Expensify and SmartScan will automatically capture the receipt details including the merchant, date, total, and currency.

{% include selector.html values="desktop, mobile" %}

{% include option.html value="desktop" %}
<ol type="a">
   <li>Click the <b>Expenses</b> tab.</li>
   <li>Click the + icon in the top right and select <b>Scan Receipt</b>.</li>  
   <li>Upload a saved image of a receipt.</li>   
</ol> 
{% include end-option.html %}

{% include option.html value="mobile" %}
<ol type="a">
   <li>Open the mobile app and tap the camera icon in the bottom right corner.</li>
   <li>Upload or take a photo of your receipt.</li>  
       <ul>
           <li>Upload a photo: Click the photo icon in the left corner and select the image from your device.</li>
           <li>Take a photo: Click the camera icon in the right corner to select the mode, make sure all of the transaction details are clearly visible, and then take the photo.</li>
           <ul>
              <li>Normal Mode: Upload one receipt.</li>
              <li>Rapid Fire Mode: Upload multiple receipts at once.</li>
           </ul>
       </ul>
</ol>
{% include end-option.html %}

{% include end-selector.html %}

You can open any receipt and select **Fill out details myself** to add or edit the merchant, date, total, description, category, or add attendees who took part in the expense. You can also split the expense if multiple expenses are included on one receipt.

{% include info.html %}
You can also email receipts to SmartScan by sending them to receipts@expensify.com from an email address tied to your Expensify account (either a primary or secondary email). SmartScan will automatically pull all of the details from the receipt, fill them in for you, and add the receipt to the Expenses tab on your account.

   <li>Click the + icon in the top right.</li>

# 5. Connect your expense accounts

You can connect your bank account(s) and personal credit card(s) to import and track your transactions in Expensify. This will: 
- Automatically sync your bank/card transactions with your Expensify account 
- Merge any expenses added with SmartScan with the tracked bank expense
- Generate IRS-compliant eReceipts (if enabled for the workspace)

{% include selector.html values="desktop, mobile" %}

{% include option.html value="desktop" %}
<ol type="a">
   <li>Hover over Settings, then click <b>Account</b>.</li>
   <li>Click the <b>Credit Card Import</b> tab on the left.</li>
   <li>Click <b>Import Bank/Card</b>.</li>
   <li>Choose your bank from the list or use the search box.</li>
       <ul>

       </ul>

{% include end-option.html %}

{% include option.html value="mobile" %}
<ol type="a">
   <li>Tap the ☰ menu icon in the top left.</li>
   <li>Tap <b>Settings</b>.</li>
   <li>Tap <b>Import a Card</b>.</li>

       </ul>
   <li>Select a transaction start date (up to 90 days), then click <b>Take me there</b>.</li>
   <li>Enter the username and password you use to sign into the bank online.</li>

</ol>

# 6. See your spending insights

The Insights dashboard allows you to monitor all aspects of company spend across categories, employees, projects, departments, and more. You can see trends in real time, forecast company budgets, and build unlimited custom reports with help from our trained specialist team.

{% include info.html %}
This process is currently not available from the mobile app and must be completed from the Expensify website.
{% include end-info.html %}  

<ol type="a">
   <li>Click the <b>Insights</b> tab.</li>
   <li>Use the To and From filters to select a specific date range. The current month is shown by default.</li>
   <li>Use the other filters to select the data you want to view insights for.</li>
       <ul>
          <li>To view your expense insights across all workspaces, tags, employees, etc., ensure “All” is selected for each filter.</li>
          <li>To view expense insights for specific workspaces, tags, employees, etc., select the desired data for each applicable filter.</li>         
       </ul>  
   <li>Scroll down to see the various data graphs.</li>
   <li>To view the specific expenses that are included in the graph, click the ☰ icon in the View Raw Data column.</li>
</ol>

# 7. Secure your account

Add an extra layer of security to help keep your financial data safe and secure by enabling two-factor authentication. This will require you to enter a code generated by your preferred authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) when you log in.

<ol type="a">
   <li>Hover over Settings, then click <b>Account</b>.</li>
   <li>Under the Account Details tab, scroll down to the Two Factor Authentication section and enable the toggle.</li>  
   <li>Save a copy of your backup codes. This step is critical—You will lose access to your account if you cannot use your authenticator app and do not have your recovery codes.</li>  
       <ul>
           <li>Click <b>Download</b> to save a copy of your backup codes to your computer.</li>
           <li>Click <b>Copy</b> to paste the codes into a document or other secure location.</li>
       </ul>
   <li>Click <b>Continue</b>.</li>
   <li>Download or open your authenticator app and either:</li>
       <ul>
           <li>Scan the QR code shown on your computer screen.</li>
           <li>Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app into Expensify and click <b>Verify</b>.</li>
       </ul>
</ol>

When you log in to Expensify in the future, you’ll be emailed a magic code that you’ll use to log in with. Then you’ll be prompted to open your authenticator app to get the 6-digit code and enter it into Expensify. A new code regenerates every few seconds, so the code is always different. If the code time runs out, you can generate a new code as needed.
