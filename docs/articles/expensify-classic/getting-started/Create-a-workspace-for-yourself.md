title: Create a Workspace for Yourself
description: Get started with Expensify by creating a workspace to track your expenses as a freelancer or individual user.
---

Creating a workspace in Expensify Classic is the first step to organizing your expenses and managing your finances efficiently. This guide walks you through setting up your workspace so you can seamlessly track receipts, submit reports, and stay on top of your spending.

All Expensify accounts include an Individual Workspace, which allows you to track personal expenses. If you want to connect your personal expenses to an accounting or travel integration, you can create a Group Workspace — even if you are the only member.
