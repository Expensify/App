# How to get support in Expensify

## Concierge

Reach out to Concierge when you have general questions about Expensify. Concierge can also be used to manage expenses, submit reports, and automate approvals. You can contact Concierge while logged into your Expensify account by clicking **Support** on the left-hand menu and then selecting **Concierge**.

Try questions such as:
- What is SmartScan?
- How do I add a mileage expense from the mobile app?
- Where can I add a Secondary Login?

## Setup Specialist

Expensify provides onboarding guidance for anyone through a Setup Specialist! You can contact your Setup Specialist while logged into your Expensify account by clicking **Support** on the left-hand menu and then selecting **Account Setup Specialist**.

### What to expect from your Setup Specialist:

- Personalized Support: Your Setup Specialist is here to assist you with tailored support. They can answer your questions and arrange screen share calls to help you set up your Expensify account or familiarize you with the product.

- Product Demos: Are you curious about how the Expensify Card works or how it integrates with your accounting software? Just let your Setup Specialist know, and they'll guide you and your team through any feature you'd like to explore.

- Setup Assistant: You don't have to do it alone when setting up your Expensify account. When you're ready to begin, chat with your Setup Specialist in the #admins room. They'll ensure everything is configured correctly right from the start.


## Account Manager

If you have more than ten active users, or you're an ExpensifyApproved! Accountant's client, you're eligible for a designated Account Manager.

Once you've completed onboarding to Expensify with your Setup Specialist, your Account Manager will take over as the main point of contact. Your account manager is there to support you and other Workspace admins in reviewing your account, advising on best practices, and making changes to your Workspace on your behalf whenever you need a hand. 

They will actively monitor open technical issues and be proactive with recommendations to increase efficiency and minimize time spent on expense management.

### How to contact your Account Manager

If you are a Workspace admin or domain admin, you will hear from your Account Manager as soon as one is assigned to your company.

Unlike Concierge, an Account Manager’s support will not be real-time, 24 hours a day. Your Account Manager will be as responsive as possible when online, but anything sent when they’re offline will not be responded to until they’re working again.

You can contact your Account Manager while logged into your Expensify account by clicking **Support** on the left-hand menu and then selecting **Account Manager**.

## Partner Manager

A Partner Manager is a dedicated point of contact to support our ExpensifyApproved! Accountants with questions about their Expensify account. Partner Managers support our accounting partners by providing recommendations for client’s accounts, assisting with firm-wide training, and ensuring partners receive the full benefits of our partnership program. They will actively monitor open technical issues and be proactive with recommendations to increase efficiency and minimize time spent on expense management.

For your firm to be assigned a Partner Manager, you must complete the [ExpensifyApproved! University]([url](https://use.expensify.com/accountants-program)) training course. Every external accountant or bookkeeper who completes the training is automatically enrolled in our program and receives benefits, including access to a Partner Manager. Everyone at your firm must complete the training to receive the maximum benefit.

### How to contact your Partner Manager

Your Partner Manager should reach out to you once you've completed ExpensifyApproved! University. Otherwise, you can contact your Partner Manager anytime by clicking **Support** on the left-hand menu and then selecting **Partner Manager**.

## Tips on Contacting Expensify Support

- **Practice Kindness**: Remember that we're here to help. Please be polite, considerate, and patient as we work together to resolve any concerns you have.

# FAQ
## Who gets an Account Manager?
Members who have 10 or more active users, or clients of ExpensifyApproved! Accounts are automatically assigned a dedicated Account Manager. 

To be assigned an Account Manager immediately, log into your Expensify account and go to **Settings > Workspaces > Group**, then click **Subscription** and increase your subscription size to 10 or more.

## What if I’m unable to reach my Account Manager?
If you’re unable to reach your account manager, then you can always reach out to Concierge for assistance. Your account manager will always reply once they’re online again.

## Can I schedule a call with my Account Manager?
Of course! You can ask your Account Manager for a call whenever you think one might be helpful. 

What makes a successful call with an Account Manager:
- Scheduling the call using their calendar link (this should be shared with you once you're assigned an Account Manager)
- Listing out exactly what you'd like to go over with the Account Manager, and then sharing that list with them before the call
- Having anyone else in your organization who regularly manages your Expensify setup join the call

## When should I chat with Concierge instead of my Account Manager?
If you have a general question about the status of a report or updating an account setting, Concierge is more than capable of getting you the answers you need. 

We recommend working with Concierge on general support questions, as this team is always online and available to help immediately.

## Who gets assigned a Setup Specialist?
This feature is specifically for new members! Whenever you start a free trial, a product Setup Specialist will be assigned to guide you through configuring your Expensify account.
