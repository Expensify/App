# 1. Meet Concierge

Your personal assistant, Concierge, lives on your Expensify Home page on both desktop and the mobile app.

Concierge will walk you through setting up your account and also provide:
- Reminders to do things like submit your expenses
- Alerts when more information is needed on an expense report
- Updates on new and improved account features 

You can also get support at any time by clicking the green chat bubble in the right corner. This will open a chat with Concierge where you can ask questions and receive direct support.
 
# 2. Create a workspace

<ol type="a">
   <li>Hover over Settings, then click <b>Workspaces</b>.</li>
   <li>Click the <b>Group</b> tab on the left.</li>  
   <li>Enter a name for the workspace (the name of your business or department is a great choice, if applicable), then click <b>Select</b> next to the workspace type that best fits your needs.</li>
</ol>

# 3. Add a business bank account

Connecting your business bank account allows you to:
- Reimburse expenses via direct bank transfer
- Pay bills
- Collect invoice payments
- Issue Expensify Cards

{% include info.html %}
The person who completes this process does not need to be a signer on the account, however they will be required to enter their own personal information as well. If someone other than the Expensify account holder enters their personal information in this section, the details will be flagged for review, and adding the bank account to Expensify will be delayed.

</ol>

# 5. Set approval rules

Determine the basic guidelines that apply to all submitted expenses. If a submitted expense does not meet these rules, it will be flagged as a violation. You can set rules for expenses, per diem, travel, and reports. 

<ol type="a">
   <li>Hover over Settings, then click <b>Workspaces</b>.</li>
   <li>Click the <b>Group</b> tab on the left.</li>  
   <li>Click the desired workspace name.</li>  
   <li>Click the <b>Expenses</b> tab and set the desired rules.</li>  
       <ul>
           <li>Determine if expense violations will be enforced. If enabled, expenses that exceed the set number of days or amount will be flagged as an expense violation.</li>
           <li>Determine how cash expenses are treated.</li> 
           <li>Determine if expenses can be re-billed to someone else as an invoice.</li> 
           <li>Determine if eRecipts can be submitted as proof of an expense.</li> 
         
{% include info.html %}
If eReceipts are enabled, imported credit card expenses of $75 USD or less will be tracked automatically—no paper receipt is necessary. 

eReceipts meet IRS documentation requirements as per Publication 463; However, the IRS will not accept an eReceipt for lodging purchases (for example, hotel expenses will require a paper receipt).
{% include end-info.html %}
           
           <li>Determine if receipts are visible to anyone with the URL.</li> 

{% include info.html %}
If disabled, receipts can be seen only by admins for the workspace or someone who has been sent the report that the receipts are related to. 
{% include end-info.html %}

           <li>Set your mileage rates for distance expenses.</li> 
           <li>Determine if time expenses can be submitted as an hourly rate.</li> 
       </ul>
   <li>Click the <b>Reports</b> tab and set the desired rules.</li>
       <ul>
           <li>Set the currency that will be used for all reports.</li>
           <li>Determine if Schedule Submit will be allowed. If enabled, all created expenses will be automatically assigned to a report. Concierge will then submit expenses for approval on the employee's behalf instantly either daily, weekly, etc., based on your frequency setting.</li>
           <li>Determine if a default report title will be required. If enabled, all reports will be named based on the set formula.</li>
           <li>Determine if additional fields should be added to each report or invoice.</li>
       </ul>
   <li>Click the <b>Travel</b> tab and set the desired rules.</li>
       <ul>
           <li>Determine what flight class and hotel rating Concierge should select when booking travel. Concierge can automatically book flights and hotels for your employees if they have an Expensify card.</li>
       </ul>
   <li>Click the <b>Per Diem</b> tab and set the desired rules.</li>
       <ul>
           <li>Determine if per diem expenses will be allowed. Then import your per diem expense rules spreadsheet that contains the list of location-based expense amounts (for example, an employee in California might receive a different amount for lunch than an employee in Louisiana).</li>
       </ul> 
</ol>

# 6. Secure your account

Add an extra layer of security to help keep your financial data safe and secure by enabling two-factor authentication. This will require you to enter a code generated by your preferred authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) when you log in.

<ol type="a">
   <li>Hover over Settings, then click <b>Account</b>.</li>
   <li>Under the Account Details tab, scroll down to the Two Factor Authentication section and enable the toggle.</li>  
   <li>Save a copy of your backup codes. This step is critical—You will lose access to your account if you cannot use your authenticator app and do not have your recovery codes.</li>  
       <ul>
           <li>Click <b>Download</b> to save a copy of your backup codes to your computer.</li>
           <li>Click <b>Copy</b> to paste the codes into a document or other secure location.</li>
       </ul>
   <li>Click <b>Continue</b>.</li>
   <li>Download or open your authenticator app and either:</li>
       <ul>
           <li>Scan the QR code shown on your computer screen.</li>
           <li>Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app into Expensify and click <b>Verify</b>.</li>
       </ul>
</ol>

When you log in to Expensify in the future, you’ll be emailed a magic code that you’ll use to log in with. Then you’ll be prompted to open your authenticator app to get the 6-digit code and enter it into Expensify. A new code regenerates every few seconds, so the code is always different. If the code time runs out, you can generate a new code as needed.
