# Overview
In this article, we'll outline helpful tips for using Expensify, such as keyboard shortcuts and text formatting.

# How to Format Text in Expensify
You can use a basic markdown in report comments to emphasize or clarify your sentiments. This includes italicizing, bolding, and strikethrough for text, as well as adding basic hyperlinks.
Formatting is consistent across both web and mobile applications, with three markdown options available for your report comments:
- **Bold:** Place an asterisk on either side (*bold*)
- **Italicize:** Place an underscore on either side (_italic_)
- **Strikethrough:** Place a tilde on either side (~strikethrough~)

# How to Use Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts can speed things up and simplify tasks. Expensify offers several shortcuts for your convenience. Let's explore them!
- **Shift + ?** - Opens the keyboard shortcuts dialog
- **Shift + G** - Prompts you for a reportID to open the report page for a specific report
- **ESC** - Closes any shortcut dialog window
- **Ctrl+Enter** - Submit a comment on a report from the comment field in the Report History & Comments section.
- **Shift + P** - Takes you to the report’s policy when you’re on a report
- **Shift + →** - Go to the next report
- **Shift + ←** - Go to the previous report
- **Shift + R** - Reloads the current page
  
# How to Create a Copy of a Report
If you have identical monthly expenses and want to copy them easily, visit your Reports page, check the box next to the report you would like to duplicate, and click "Copy" to duplicate all expenses (excluding receipt images).
If you prefer, you can create a standard template for certain expenses:
1. Go to the Reports page.
2. Click "New Report."
3. Assign an easily searchable name to the report.
4. Click the green '+' button to add an expense.
5. Choose "New Expense."
6. Select the type of expense (e.g., regular expense, distance, time, etc.).
7. Enter the expense details, code, and any relevant description.
8. Click "Save."
**Pro Tip:** If you use Scheduled Submit, place the template report under your individual workspace to avoid accidental submission. When you're ready to use it, check the report box, copy it, and make necessary changes to the name and workspace.
