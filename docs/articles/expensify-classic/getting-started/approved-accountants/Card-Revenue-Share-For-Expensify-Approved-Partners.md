Start making more with us! We're thrilled to announce a new incentive for our US-based ExpensifyApproved! partner accountants. You can now earn additional income for your firm every time your client uses their Expensify Card.  **In short, your firm gets 0.5% of your clientsâ€™ total Expensify Card spend as cash back**. The more your clients spend, the more cashback your firm receives!<br>
<br>This program is currently only available to US-based ExpensifyApproved! partner accountants.

# How-to

# FAQ
- What if my firm is not permitted to accept revenue share from our clients? <br>
<br>We understand that different firms may have different policies. If your firm is unable to accept this revenue share, you can pass the revenue share back to your client to give them an additional 0.5% of cash back using your own internal payment tools.<br><br>
- What if my firm does not wish to participate in the program? <br>
<br>Please reach out to your assigned partner manager at new.expensify.com to inform them you would not like to accept the revenue share nor do you want to pass the revenue share to your clients.
