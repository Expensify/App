# About
The Copilot feature allows you to safely delegate tasks without sharing login information. Your chosen user can access your account through their own Expensify account, with customizable permissions to manage expenses, create reports, and more. This can even be extended to users outside your policy or domain.

# How-to
# How to add a Copilot
1. Log into the Expensify desktop website.
2. Navigate to *Settings > Account > Account Details > _Copilot: Delegated Access_*.
3. Enter the email address or phone number of your Copilot and select whether you want to give them Full Access or the ability to Submit Only.
   - *Full Access Copilot*: Your Copilot will have full access to your account. Nearly every action you can do and everything you can see in your account will also be available to your Copilot. They *will not* have the ability to add or remove other Copilots from your account.
   - *Submit Only Copilot*: Your Copilot will have the same limitations as a Full Access Copilot, with the added restriction of not being able to approve reports on your behalf.
4. Click Invite Copilot.

If your Copilot already has an Expensify account, they will get an email notifying them that they can now access your account from within their account as well.
If they do not already have an Expensify account, they will be provided with a link to create one. Once they have created their Expensify account, they will be able to access your account from within their own account.
