# How to manage contact preferences

# How to set your time zone
Wherever you are, we'll time-stamp your report actions according to your local time. This helps you keep track of when submissions or approvals occurred. Setting your time zone in Expensify is simple and ensures accurate time-stamping for your report actions, especially in the comments section of the expense report you're reviewing.

To set your time zone:
Navigate to **Settings > Account > Preferences > Scroll down to Time Zone**

 **Note:** To set your time zone automatically based on your location, tick the box that says **Set my time zone automatically**.

If you prefer to set your time zone manually, leave the box unticked and select your time zone from the searchable list of locations.

When you add a comment to a report, all the report actions will be time-stamped in your local time. Adjusting your time zone to the appropriate location makes tracking and understanding submission and approval times much easier.

# FAQ
## The profile picture on my account updated automatically. Why did this happen? 
Our focus is always on making your experience user-friendly and saving you valuable time. One of the ways we achieve this is by utilizing a public API to retrieve public data linked to your email address.

This tool searches for public accounts or profiles associated with your email address, such as on LinkedIn. When it identifies one, it pulls in the uploaded profile picture and name to Expensify.

While this automated process is generally accurate, there may be instances where it's not entirely correct. If this happens, we apologize for any inconvenience caused. The good news is that rectifying such situations is a straightforward process. You can quickly update your information manually by following the directions provided above, ensuring your data is accurate and up to date in no time.
