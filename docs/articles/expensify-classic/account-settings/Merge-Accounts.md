# Overview

Merging accounts allows you to combine two accounts. When you combine two accounts, all receipts, expenses, expense reports, invoices, bills, imported cards, secondary logins, co-pilots, and group policy settings will be combined into one account. 
This can be useful if you start off with an account of your own but your organization creates a separate account for you. You can then track both personal and business expenses via one account. 

# How to merge accounts
Merging two accounts together is fairly straightforward. Let’s go over how to do that below:
1. Navigate to [expensify.com](https://www.expensify.com)
2. Log into the account you want to set as the Primary account
3. Navigate to Settings > Account > Account Details
4. Scroll down to the Merge Accounts section and fill in the fields. Once you click Merge, a magic code link will be sent to you via email and you'll be prompted to enter the magic code
5. Copy the magic code, switch back to the expensify.com page, and paste the code into the required field
6. Click Merge Accounts

# FAQ
## Can you merge accounts from the mobile app?
No, accounts can only be merged from the full website at expensify.com.
## Can I administratively merge two accounts together?
No, only the account holder (user) can perform account merging.
## Is merging accounts reversible?
No, merging accounts is not reversible. It is a permanent action that cannot be undone.
## Are there any restrictions on account merging?
Yes! Please see below:
* If your email address belongs to a verified domain (verified in Expensify), you must start the process from the email account under the verified domain. You cannot merge a verified company email account into a personal account.
* If you have two accounts with two different verified domains, you cannot merge them together.
## What happens to my “personal” Individual policy when merging accounts?
The old “personal” Individual policy will be deleted. If you plan to submit reports under a different policy in the future, ensure that any reports on the Individual policy in the old account are marked as Open before merging the accounts. You can typically do this by selecting “Undo Submit” on any submitted reports.
