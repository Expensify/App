# FAQs

**Can a Copilot’s secondary login be used to forward receipts?**

Yes, a Copilot can use any of the email addresses tied to their account to forward receipts into the account they are copiloting. To ensure a receipt is routed to the Expensify account you are copiloting instead of your own account, email the receipt to receipts@expensify.com with the email address of the account you are copiloting as the subject line of the email. 

**Can I add another copilot to an account that I’m copiloting?**

No, only the original account holder can add another Copilot to their account.
