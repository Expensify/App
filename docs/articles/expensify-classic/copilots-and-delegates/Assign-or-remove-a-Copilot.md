You can safely delegate tasks to someone else without sharing your login information by assigning them as your **Copilot**. A Copilot can access your Expensify account through their own login to:

- Prepare expenses on your behalf.
- Approve and reimburse expense reports (Full Access Copilots only).
- View and modify your account, domain, and workspace settings.
- View all expenses visible in your account.

# Assign a Copilot

1. Go to **Settings > Account > Profile**.
2. Under **Copilot Access**, enter the email or phone number of the person you want to assign as your Copilot.
3. Select the access level:
   - **Full Access**: The Copilot can manage expenses, approvals, reimbursements, and account settings but **cannot** add or remove other Copilots.
   - **Submit Only Access**: The Copilot can submit reports but **cannot** approve them.
4. Click **Invite copilot**.

**Note:** If the invited person has an Expensify account, they’ll receive an email notification. Otherwise, they’ll get a link to create an account.

# Remove a Copilot

1. Go to **Settings > Account > Profile**.
2. Under **Copilot Access**, find the Copilot you want to remove.
3. Click the **red X** next to their name to remove them.

**Note:** Only the account owner can remove a Copilot. Copilots cannot remove other Copilots.

**On the mobile app:**
1. Tap the **menu icon** in the top left.
