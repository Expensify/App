# FAQ  

## Can a Copilot’s secondary login be used to forward receipts?  
Yes. A Copilot can forward receipts to the account they are co-piloting from any email address linked to their own Expensify account.  

To ensure the receipt is sent to the correct account, email it to **receipts@expensify.com** and enter the copiloted account’s email in the subject line.  

## Can I add another Copilot to an account I’m co-piloting?  
No. Only the account owner can assign additional Copilots.
