title: Domain Migration
description: Change the email address and domain for all users in Expensify
---

If your business changes its email domain and needs to move everyone to new email addresses, you may be able to automatically migrate your Expensify accounts over to the new domain, or our team can help you manually complete the process. 

{% include info.html %}
If your company uses Expensify Cards, do not create your new domain or request Expensify cards on the new domain. The Expensify Team must complete the migration for you in this case. Message Concierge or your Account Manager to start the process.
{% include end-info.html %}

## Automatic Migration
If certain conditions are met, Expensify can simply rename your domain. This means that your Domain settings will stay the same, but the name will change and all users will get a new email address as their primary login. Their old email address will remain on their account as a secondary login.

If the answer to each of these questions is “yes,” we can automatically migrate your domain and users:

- Is your current domain, or the new domain, verified?
- Do the emails map 1:1 (i.e., name@olddomain.com becomes name@new.com and not firstname.lastename@new.com)?
- Have your users refrained from creating Expensify accounts under their new email addresses?

If all of these answers are “yes,” message Concierge to request a “Domain Migration.” This process will usually take a few business days. If you answered “no” for any of the questions, continue to the manual migration process below. 

## Manual Migration
If we can’t automatically migrate your domain, you can leverage your users to migrate everyone manually. 

{% include info.html %}
Follow the steps below in the exact order they are presented.
{% include end-info.html %}

1. Have all employees add their new email address as a [Secondary Login](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/settings/account-settings/Change-or-add-email-address) to their current account.
2. [Claim and verify](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Claim-And-Verify-A-Domain) your new Domain.
3. If you use [Domain Groups](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Create-A-Group) on your old domain, disable “Restrict Primary Login Selection” on all groups.
4. Have each user switch their Primary and Secondary Login email addresses so the new email address is the primary login.
5. Add any card feeds. If you need to move a commercial card feed, reach out to concierge@expensify.com, as we’ll need to do this for you. 

{% include info.html %}
Before completing this process, you must resolve any unprocessed transactions, as your cards will be unassigned from the previous domain and assigned to the new one. That means that any unprocessed transactions on the previous domain will be deleted when the cards are unassigned.
{% include end-info.html %}

6. Enter the transaction start date so that your transactions will not overlap with the previous import but will continue from the previous assignment.
7. Reset your old domain to remove any domain restrictions:
    - Remove all domain admins
    - The last admin left will see a Reset button to click
8. If your employees have already set up an additional account under the new email address, they will need to [merge their accounts](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/settings/account-settings/Merge-accounts).
9. Set up your [domain groups](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Create-A-Group) on the new domain and add your users to the relevant group.
