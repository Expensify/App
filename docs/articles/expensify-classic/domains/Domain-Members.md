Managing domain members in Expensify ensures control over access and settings within your organization. This guide walks you through adding, removing, and promoting users to streamline domain administration.

There are two types of users within Domain Settings:
- **Domain Member**: Managed by Domain Admins and subject to domain rules. Members cannot modify settings and must have an email address under the domain (e.g., @yourcompany.com) as their primary or secondary email.
- **Domain Admin**: This person has full control over domain settings, including adding/removing members, managing rules, and handling company credit cards. Admins do not need an email associated with the domain. Only Domain Admins can manage domain settings and member information.

The domain must be [verified](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Claim-And-Verify-A-Domain) before you can add members.

# Add a Domain Member
There are two ways to add a member:
1. **Automatic Signup**: Users who create an account using a domain email (e.g., yourname@yourcompany.com) are automatically added.
2. **Manual Addition**: A Domain Admin can invite members manually.

## Automatic Domain Member Signup
- **New Expensify Users**: Accounts created with a domain email are automatically added as members.
- **Existing Expensify Users**: Users can add their domain email as a primary or secondary email. Once verified, they are added to the domain.

The primary email listed under the domain will take precedence, even if the secondary email matches the domain.

Once verified, all Domain Admins are notified, and the member is added to the default group.

## Manually Add a Domain Member
1. Go to **Settings > Domains**.
2. Select the domain.
3. Click **Domain Members**.
4. Enter the member’s email prefix and click **Invite**.

# Remove a Domain Member

# Add a Domain Admin
