{% include info.html %}
To add members to your domain, your domain must be verified. Once a domain is verified, only Domain Admins will have access to the domain’s settings and member information. 
{% include end-info.html %}

Your domain can include members and admins.  
 - **Domain Member**: Domain Members are associated with a specific domain and managed by the rules configured by the Domain Admins. They cannot see or modify any of the domain settings. A Domain Member must have an email address under the domain name (for example, an email address @yourcompany.com) listed as their primary or secondary email address. 
- **Domain Admin**: Has full authority over the domain settings and can add or modify members, admin, groups, rules, and company credit cards. Domain Admins are not required to have an email address connected to the domain. 

# Add Domain Member

There are two ways to add a member to a domain: 
- The member can be automatically added to the domain if they sign up or are added to Expensify using an email address that contains their domain name (for example, an email address @yourcompany.com).
- A Domain Admin can manually add a new member to the domain.

## Automatic Domain Member signup

- **New Expensify members**: By creating their account using their domain email address (like yourname@yourcompany.com), they will be automatically added as a member of the domain.
- **Existing Expensify members**: Members that already have an Expensify account can add their domain email address (like yourname@yourcompany.com) as their secondary or primary email address to be automatically added as a member of the domain once they verify their email address. 

{% include info.html %}
The member’s primary email address will be the one that is listed under the domain, even if their secondary email address is the one that matches the domain.
{% include end-info.html %}

Once the member verifies their email address, all Domain Admins will be notified and the employee will be added to the default group. 

## Manually add a Domain Member

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Domains**.
2. Click the name of the domain. 
3. Click the **Domain Members** tab on the left. 
4. Under the Domain Members section, enter the first part of the member’s email address and click **Invite**. 

# Add Domain Admin

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Domains**.
2. Click the name of the domain. 
3. Click the **Domain Admins** tab on the left.
4. Under the Domain Admins section, enter the phone number or email address of the person you’re inviting as a domain admin and click **Add Admin**. 

{% include info.html %}
This can be any email address—it does not have to be an email address under the domain. 
{% include end-info.html %}
