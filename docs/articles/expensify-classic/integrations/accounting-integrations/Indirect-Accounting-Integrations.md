# Overview

Along with the direct integrations Expensify supports, there's also an option to integrate with other accounting solutions via a flat-file import.

When you set up one of these accounting packages in Expensify, we will automatically create and add a relevant export template. The template will allow you to quickly and easily transfer expense and report data to your accounting package.

# How to Set Up an Indirect Accounting Integration

## Home Page

After selecting your Group Plan type for your first workspace, you'll be taken through a few workspace setup tasks on the home page. When you reach the **Accounting Software** task, select your accounting solution from the available options.

You'll receive a confirmation message, and the respective export template will be added to the account. From then on, it will show in the **Export to** option on the **Reports** page and at the top of each report.

## Workspace Settings

Head to **Settings** > **Workspaces** > **Group** > _Your desired workspace_ > **Connections** and select an accounting package from the options listed here. You'll receive a confirmation message, and the respective export template will be added to the account. From then on, it will show in the **Export to** option on the **Reports** page and at the top of each report.

# How to Export a Report for My Accounting Package

You can export reports to these templates in two ways:

To export a report, click **Export To** in the top-left of a report and select your accounting package from the dropdown menu.

To export multiple reports, tick the checkbox next to the reports on the **Reports** page, then click **Export To** and select your accounting package from the dropdown menu.

# FAQ

## What if my accounting package isn’t listed here?

If your accounting package isn’t listed, but it still accepts a flat-file import, select **Other** when completing the Accounting Software task on your Home page or head to **Settings** > **Workspaces** > **Group** > _Your desired workspace_ > **Export Formats**.  This option allows you to create your own templates to export your expense and report data into a format compatible with your accounting system.
