title: Workday Integration
description: Automatically sync employees between Workday and Expensify
---

# Overview
By leveraging Expensify's [Employee Updater API](https://integrations.expensify.com/Integration-Server/doc/employeeUpdater/), you can set up a fully customizable integration between Workday and Expensify. This integration can:

- **Provision new employees in Expensify:** Employees are automatically invited to the correct Expensify workspace on their start date based on data in Workday.
- **Update employees and approval workflows:** Any changes to employee email and manager are automatically updated in Expensify.
- **Deprovision employees:** Employees can optionally be removed from their primary Expensify workspace on their termination date.
Please note that while your Account Manager can help advise on setting up the Workday integration, the Expensify API is a self-serve tool.

# How to set up an Advanced Custom Report in Workday
The first step to integrating Workday with Expensify is to create an advanced custom report in Workday. This report can:
- Map Workday column data to an Expensify Workspace for import.
- Import employee names, email addresses and manager emails into the Expensify Workspace.
- Set the employee’s **Submits To** column in the Expensify Members table.
- Set the employee's Expensify **Custom Field 1 & 2**, typically used for Employee ID, Cost Center and/or Legal Entity.
- Add employees to different Expensify Domain Groups.
- Auto-assign Expensify Cards.

In order to complete the steps below, you'll need a Workday System Administrator to create an **Integration System User** and **Integration System Security Group**.

## Create an Integration System User
1. Search "create user" and click **Create Integration System User**.
2. Add a password, leave **Require New Password at Next Sign In** unchecked, set **Session Timeout Minutes** to 0, and check **Do Not Allow UI Sessions**.
3. Click **OK**.

## Create a Security Group
1. Search "create security group", then click **Create Security Group**.
2. Create a **Constrained** security group and specify the **Organizations** you'd like to sync data from.
3. Add the **Integration System User** you created to your **Security Group**.
4. Search and select "security group membership and access".
5. Search for the security group you just created.
6. Click the ellipsis, then **Security Group > Maintain Domain Permissions for Security Group**.
7. Under **Integration Permissions**, add "External Account Provisioning" to **Domain Security Workspaces permitting Put access** and "Worker Data: Workers" to **Domain Security Workspaces permitting Get access**.
8. Click **OK** and **Done**.
9. Search **Activate Pending Security Workspace Changes** and complete the task for activating the security workspace change, adding a comment if required and checking the **Confirmed** check-box.

## Create the Advanced Custom Report
Before completing the steps below, you will need Workday Report Writer access to create an Advanced Custom Report in Workday and enable it as a RAAS (Report as a Service).

1. Search “Create Custom Report” and click **Create Custom Report**.
2. Enter the report details:
    - Give the report a **Name**.
    - Set the **Report Type** to **Advanced**.
    - Check **Enable As Web Service**.
    - Uncheck **Optimized for Performance**.
    - For **Data Source**, search and select **All Active and Terminated Employees**.
    - Click **OK**.
3. Select the **Column Data** you’d like to sync with Expensify. Typical fields synced with Expensify from Workday are as follows (Required fields are marked with \*):
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Primary Work Email\*
    - Employee ID\*
    - Expensify Workspace ID\*
    - Worker’s Manager [Primary Work Email]\*
    - Domain Group ID (If you want to specify a Domain Group in Expensify, please work with your Account Manager to get your Domain Group IDs)
    - Cost Center
    - Entity ID (sometimes called Legal Entity) 
    - Active/Inactive 
    - Termination Date
    - Note: _if there is field data you want to import that is not listed above, or you have any special requests, let your Expensify Account Manager know and we will work with you to accommodate the request._
4. Rename the columns so they match Expensify's API key names (The full list of names are found here):
    - employeeID
    - customField1
    - customField2
    - firstName
    - lastName
    - employeeEmail
    - managerEmail
    - workspaceID
    - domainGroupID
    - approvesTo
Switch to the **Share** tab, and share the report with your **Integration System User** and **Security Group**.

## Enable your report as a Report as a Service (RAAS)

1. In your Workday tenant, search “view custom report” and select it. On the **View Custom Report** screen, click **My Reports**.
2. Select the report you have created and click **OK**.
3. Click **Actions > Web Service > View URLs** and click **OK**.
4. Scroll to the **JSON** section, right-click **JSON**, then select **Copy URL**.

## Activate the Workday Integration

If you would like to enable and run the API job that performs a recurring sync, you can do so by following Expensify’s API reference documentation [here](https://integrations.expensify.com/Integration-Server/doc/employeeUpdater/#api-principles). 

If you would like Expensify to perform the sync on your behalf, please follow the steps below.

1. To generate your **Expensify API Credentials**, log into Expensify with an account that has both Workspace Admin and Domain Admin access, then head to https://www.expensify.com/tools/integrations/ where you will find your partnerUserID and partnerUserSecret.
2. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > Group > _[Workspace Name]_ > Connections > HR Integrations** and click **Connect to Workday**.
3. In the form, supply the following details:
    - partnerUserID
    - partnerUserSecret
    - Workday ISU Username (e.g. ISU_Expensify)
    - Workday password
    - Workday REST Web Services URL
    - Preferred go live date (e.g. YYYY/MM/DD, or leave blank)
    - Expensify Card Auto-Assignment? (Y/N)
        - Note: If using Expensify Cards, card auto-assignment occurs when a Smart Limit for a Group is enabled.
    - Deprovision Users? (Y/N)

After you submit the form, the request is sent to your Expensify Account Manager. Your Account Manager will create a recurring sync that will retrieve the data columns from your Workday Web Services URL and apply the rule mappings you have specified above.

If we have any questions, we will reach out to you via direct message.
