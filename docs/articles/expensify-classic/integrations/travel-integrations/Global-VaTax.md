## VAT
[Value Added Tax (VAT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp#:~:text=Value%2Dadded%20tax%20(VAT)%20is%20a%20flat%20tax%20levied,different%20parties%20to%20a%20transaction.) is a consumption tax applied to goods and services in many countries. It is typically applied automatically upon purchase, however, international business travelers can reclaim some VAT. 

VAT-recoverable expenses include hotels, entertainment, conferences, legal and marketing fees, DDP shipping and storage fees, aviation recovery, and other international expenses. 
## VAT Refund
The VAT refund process is complex and requires a detailed understanding of the regulations and requirements in each country. The VAT rules and rates vary from country to country and by expense type.

You can seamlessly sync your Expensify expenses to Global VaTax for easy VAT analysis, calculation, and reporting.
