## How do I expense a prepaid hotel booking in Expensify using the Navan integration?
Bookings that weren’t made in Navan directly (such as a prepaid hotel booking) won’t auto-import into Expensify. To import these trips into Expensify, follow these steps:

1. Click the “Trips” tab in Navan.
2. Select the trip or hotel that you'd like to expense.
3. Click the “Expense to Expensify” link at the bottom of the page.

This also works for importing flights that were booked prior to setting up the integration.
