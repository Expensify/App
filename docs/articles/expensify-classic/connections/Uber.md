# Connect Uber to Expensify Classic

You can automatically import your Uber receipts into Expensify Classic by connecting your Uber account. If you leave a tip, Uber issues a **separate receipt** for it—so you'll see **two expenses** in Expensify: one for the trip and one for the tip.

## How Uber expenses are created

Expensify imports expenses based on the receipts Uber sends:

- **Trip Expense**: Created from Uber’s receipt for the base fare, taxes, and fees.
- **Tip Expense**: Created from a separate receipt if you tip your driver after the ride.

This helps ensure each charge is clearly tracked and categorized.

To connect your Uber account to Expensify:

1. Log in to [Expensify Classic](https://www.expensify.com).
2. Go to `Settings > Account > Profile`.
3. Scroll to the **Connected Accounts** section.
4. Click **Connect** next to Uber.

Once connected, Uber receipts will automatically import after each completed trip.

## Notes on Uber integration

- Tip expenses may appear a few minutes after the trip expense.
- Expensify will attempt to match duplicate receipts if SmartScanned or emailed separately.
