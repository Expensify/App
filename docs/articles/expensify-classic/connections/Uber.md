## What happens after connecting?

- Uber receipts will appear in Expensify just like SmartScanned receipts.
- If you use Scheduled Submit, your Uber receipts will be added to your next report automatically.
- If the ride was paid for with an Expensify Card, the Uber receipt will automatically merge with the corresponding card expense.

# How Uber expenses are created

Expensify imports expenses based on the receipts Uber sends:

- **Trip expense:** Created from Uber’s receipt for the base fare, taxes, and fees.
- **Tip expense:** Created from a separate receipt if you tip your driver after the ride.

This helps ensure each charge is clearly tracked and categorized.
