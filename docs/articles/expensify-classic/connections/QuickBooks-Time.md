# Overview

Connecting Expensify with TSheets/QuickBooks Time can streamline your expense tracking and time management processes. This integration allows you to automatically sync time entries from TSheets/QuickBooks Time with expenses in Expensify, ensuring accurate and efficient expense reporting. 

# How to set up the Expensify and TSheets/QuickBooks Time integration

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- **Expensify account:** You must have an active Expensify account.
- **TSheets account:** You must have a TSheets account and admin privileges to set up the integration.

Now, follow these steps to set up the integration:

1. Log into your Expensify account on your web browser

2. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > Group > Workspace Name > Connections > TSheets**

3. Click **Connect to TSheets**

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in to your TSheets account and grant Expensify access.

5. Once the integration is authorized, you may need to configure some preferences.
- Specify how you want TSheets time entries to be imported into Expensify. You can typically customize settings like the date range, project/task mapping, and expense categories.

6. Now, we’d recommend testing the integration. 
- Create a sample time entry in TSheets and check if it’s automatically reflected in your Expensify account.

7. If the test is successful, save your integration settings.
   
8. You may also want to schedule regular syncs or specify how often Expensify should pull data from TSheets.

With the integration set up, your TSheets time entries will now appear in Expensify as expenses. You can review, categorize, and submit these expenses as needed.

Congratulations! You've successfully integrated Expensify with TSheets, simplifying your expense tracking and reporting process.
