# How the Integration Works

By connecting Expensify to Deel, you can leverage Expensify’s approval workflows to ensure timely employee reimbursements via Deel. The integration links user-profiles and expense workspaces between Expensify and Deel, allowing Deel to scan for approved expenses from matched users in designated workspaces. These approved expenses are then imported into Deel for reimbursement processing.

## Key Details:
- **One-Way Sync**: Expenses approved in Expensify sync to Deel. Expenses logged in Deel will NOT sync back to Expensify.
- **Approval Workflow**: Only approved expenses in Expensify are eligible for syncing to Deel.
- **Sync Timing**: Expense syncing is not immediate. For more details, refer to [How Does Expense Syncing Work?](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/5871319525521-How-To-Set-Up-The-Expensify-Integration-On-Deel-For-EOR-Employees-And-Contractors#h_01G25AWSW0KHWBA63C1AZ6X9E9).

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the integration, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- **Deel Organization Manager permissions** (admin-level access)
- **Expensify Admin permissions** for the workspaces you want to integrate
- **A paid Expensify subscription** to approve and sync expenses

**Note:** Expensify Admin permissions can be complex. For more details, refer to [Expensify’s Introduction to Integration](https://integrations.expensify.com/Integration-Server/doc/#introduction).
