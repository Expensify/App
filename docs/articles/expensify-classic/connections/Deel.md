# Overview

This guide is for business clients who want to set up policies and synchronize expenses from Expensify to Deel. This one-way synchronization ensures that Expensify becomes the definitive source for all employee expenses.

If you are a contractor or employee working for a company using Expensify, please refer to:

- [Employee Guide to Using Expensify with Deel](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/7123572847761-Employee-s-Guide-to-Using-Expensify-With-Deel)

## Introduction:

By integrating Expensify with Deel, you can utilize Expensify’s approval workflows to ensure timely payment through Deel for your team.

This process involves aligning user profiles and expense policies between Expensify and Deel. Once connected, Deel will scan for approved expenses from matched users included in selected workspaces for integration, allowing Deel to import these expenses for reimbursement.

This synchronization is one-way. Expenses and receipts logged and approved in Expensify will sync to Deel. Expenses logged in Deel will not sync to Expensify.

*Please note,* expense syncing is not immediate. For details on how syncing operates, refer to ["How Does Expense Syncing Work?"]([https://example.com](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/5871319525521-How-To-Set-Up-The-Expensify-Integration-On-Deel-For-EOR-Employees-And-Contractors#h_01G25AWSW0KHWBA63C1AZ6X9E9))

## Before you begin:

To establish a connection, make sure you have the following:

- Deel Organization Manager permissions
- Expensify Admin permissions for policies you wish to integrate with Deel
- A paid Expensify subscription to approve expenses and sync them to Deel

Expensify Admin permissions can be intricate. Refer to [Expensify’s Introduction to Integration]([https://example.com](https://integrations.expensify.com/Integration-Server/doc/#introduction)) for more details.
