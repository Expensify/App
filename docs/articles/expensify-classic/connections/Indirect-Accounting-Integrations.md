# Indirect Accounting Integrations

Expensify supports both **direct** and **indirect** accounting integrations. If your accounting software isn’t directly integrated, you can still export expenses and reports using a **flat-file import**.

When you select an accounting package, Expensify automatically generates a relevant export template. This makes it easy to transfer your financial data to your accounting system.
