# Company Card Expenses Exporting to the Wrong Account  

**Behavior:**  
Company card transactions are exporting to the wrong account.

## Why This Happens  
This can be caused by incorrect account mapping, export settings, or user permissions.

## How to Fix It  

1. **Check How the Expense Was Imported**  
   - **Company Card Import:** Only expenses with the locked card icon follow export mapping settings configured in **Domain Control**.  
   - **Other Imports:** Expenses from individually linked cards, SmartScanned receipts, or manually created cash expenses export to the **default account** in your connection settings.

2. **Confirm Card Mapping in Domain Control**  
   - Ensure company cards are mapped to the correct accounts.

3. **Merge SmartScanned Receipts**  
   - If SmartScanned receipts should have merged with company card transactions, verify and manually merge them if necessary.

4. **Verify Export Options**  
   - Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Accounting > Configure**.  
   - Select **"Credit Card"** as the non-reimbursable export option if mapping to specific credit card accounts.

5. **Ensure the Exporter Has Domain Admin Permissions**  
   - Check the **Report Comments** section to see who exported the report.  
   - Ensure the **Preferred Exporter** in **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Accounting > Configure** is a **Domain Admin**.

6. **Check Workspace Mapping**  
   - If multiple workspaces connect to the same accounting system, ensure expenses export under the correct workspace.
