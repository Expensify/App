# Export Options

## Preferred Exporter

Any Workspace Admin can export reports to Sage Intacct, but only the Preferred Exporter will receive notifications regarding the export status.

## Export Date Options

Choose from the following export date options:
- **Date of last expense:** Uses the date of the most recent expense in the report.
- **Exported date:** Uses the date when the report is exported to Sage Intacct.
- **Submitted date:** Uses the date when the report creator originally submitted the report.

**Note:** All export options (except for credit cards) use the selected date format. Credit card transactions always use the transaction date.

## Reimbursable Expenses

Reimbursable expenses can be exported as either:
- **Expense Reports**, or
- **Vendor Bills** (depending on your initial setup).

## Non-Reimbursable Expenses

Non-reimbursable expenses will be exported separately from reimbursable expenses and can be categorized as either:
- **Vendor Bills**, or
- **Credit Card Charges** (to a selected account).

Expensify does **not** support exporting non-reimbursable expenses as **Journal Entries**.

## Configuring Company Card Export Settings
If your company centrally manages cards through **Domain Settings**, you can configure exports per cardholder:
1. Go to **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Company Cards**.
2. Select the company card connection (if multiple exist).
3. Locate the relevant cardholder.
4. Click **Edit Exports** and assign the correct account for Sage Intacct exports.

**Note:** If you have **Multi-Currency** enabled, credit card transactions must be exported to a specific entity rather than the top level.

## Exporting Negative Expenses

Negative expenses can be exported to Sage Intacct, but if using **Expense Reports**, the total report amount cannot be negative.

---

# Configure Coding Settings

The way your expense data appears in Sage Intacct depends on your coding settings in Expensify.

## Expense Types

Categories are the primary method for matching expenses to Sage Intacct accounts. The category type depends on your **Reimbursable Export** settings:
- **Expense Reports** → Categories are **Expense Types**.
- **Vendor Bills** → Categories are **Chart of Accounts** (GL Codes).

To manage categories:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > Group > [Workspace Name] > Categories**.
2. Disable unnecessary categories as needed.

**Note:** Every expense must be assigned a category to export successfully.

## Billable Expenses

Enable **Billable Expenses** to map expense types or accounts to **Items** in Sage Intacct. This requires:
- **Read-only permissions** for relevant Sage Intacct modules (e.g., Projects, Purchasing, Inventory Control, Order Entry).
- Mapping categories to items in Expensify.

If an expense is marked **Billable**, the correct category (item) must be selected to avoid export errors.

## Dimensions: Departments, Classes, and Locations

Expensify supports three-dimensional settings:
1. **Employee Default** – Applies when using **Expense Reports**.
2. **Tags** – Enables selection at the report/expense level.
3. **Report Fields** – Assigns at the report level (useful for varying locations per report).

If "Tags" appear instead of "Departments," ensure:
- **Projects** are enabled in **Tags** settings.
- Dimensions are enabled in the Sage Intacct integration settings.

## Customers and Projects

These settings are particularly relevant for billable expenses and can be assigned as **Tags** or **Report Fields**.

## Tax Settings

Expensify supports native VAT and GST tax with Sage Intacct. To enable:
1. Open **Sage Intacct Configuration** in Expensify.
2. Navigate to the **Coding** tab and toggle on **Tax**.
3. Resync the workspace to import tax rates from Sage Intacct.

**Note:** Default tax rates can be assigned per category.

## User-Defined Dimensions (UDD)

User-Defined Dimensions (UDD) can be added to your workspace by retrieving the **Integration Name** from Sage Intacct.

To find it in Sage Intacct:
1. Go to **Platform Services > Objects > List**.
2. Filter by **User-Defined Dimensions**.

To set this up:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > Group > [Workspace Name] > Accounting**.
2. Click **Configure** under Sage Intacct.
3. On the **Coding** tab, enable **User Defined Dimensions**.
4. Enter the **Integration Name** and choose whether to import it as a **Tag** or **Report Field**.
5. Click **Save**.

# Configure Advanced Settings

## Multi-Entity Sync

In multi-entity environments, select whether to sync at the **top level** or with a specific **entity**:
- **Top-Level Sync**: Imports employees and dimensions shared at the top level, exporting transactions accordingly.
- **Entity-Level Sync**: Syncs data with the selected entity.

## Auto Sync

If enabled, **non-reimbursable reports** will be exported to Sage Intacct upon final approval.

For **reimbursable expenses**, reports are exported **only after reimbursement** (if using Expensify ACH).

## Inviting Employees

Enabling **Invite Employees** will automatically:
- Add employees to your workspace.
- Create Expensify accounts for them (if they don't have one).

If your domain is verified, the Expensify account linked to Sage Intacct must be a **Domain Admin**.

## Importing Sage Intacct Approvals

When enabled, Expensify will set each employee’s **Sage Intacct Manager** as their **first approver**.

Approval options:
- **Basic Approval**: All users submit to one approver.
- **Manager Approval**: Employees submit to their Sage Intacct manager, who may forward to a final approver.
- **Configure Manually**: Employees are imported, but the approval workflow is set up manually.

## Sync Reimbursed Reports

When using Expensify ACH, reimbursed reports will export as:
- **Vendor Bills** (to the default AP account in Sage Intacct).
- **Expense Reports** (to the Employee Liabilities account).

If **Auto Sync** is enabled, **Bill Payments** will be created upon reimbursement.

**Note:** Sage Intacct requires Bill Payments to be assigned to **Cash and Cash Equivalents** accounts.

# FAQ

## Why didn’t my report export automatically to Sage Intacct?

If your report didn't export automatically, here are some possible reasons: 
- The **Preferred Exporter** will receive an email and an **Inbox task** with details.
- The **Report Comments** section will also display error messages.

Check the Expensify **Community** for solutions or contact Concierge for assistance.

## How can I ensure reports are final approved before export?

Make sure your **approval workflow** is correctly configured. If your domain is verified, enforce workspace workflows via:
**Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Groups**.

## What happens to existing reports if I enable Auto Sync?

- Reports **not exported** to Sage Intacct will remain unaffected.
- Reports **already exported and reimbursed** will be marked **Paid** in Sage Intacct on the next sync.
- Reports **marked paid in Sage Intacct** will be marked **Reimbursed** in Expensify.
- Reports **not yet exported** will **not** be automatically exported.
