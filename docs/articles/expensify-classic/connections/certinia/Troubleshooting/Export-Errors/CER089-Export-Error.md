# CER089 Export Error: Assignment Required for Project

If you see the error:

**“CER089 Export Error: Assignment required for 'Project'. Please add assignment in Certinia.”**

this means the selected Project in Certinia requires an assignment before expenses can be exported.

Until this requirement is addressed, Certinia will block the export.

## Why CER089 Happens

In Certinia, some Project configurations require expenses to be linked to an assignment.

If the Project setting does not allow expenses without an assignment, and no assignment is associated with the expense, Certinia fails validation and returns error **CER089**.

This is a Certinia Project configuration issue — not an Expensify Workspace configuration issue.

## Who Can Fix CER089

You must have access to edit Project settings in Certinia (typically a Certinia Admin or Project Admin) to resolve this error.
