# CER937 Error: Please Update Expensify in Certinia

If you see the error:

**“CER937 Error: Please update Expensify in Certinia.”**

this means Certinia has received a newer version of the Expensify integration, but the configuration in Certinia has not yet been updated.

Until the integration is updated in Certinia, exports and syncs from Expensify may fail.

---

## Why CER937 Happens

Certinia periodically releases updates to the Expensify integration.

When Certinia detects that a newer version of the integration is available but not installed or configured, it blocks export activity and returns error **CER937**.

This is a Certinia configuration issue — not an Expensify Workspace configuration issue.

---

## Who Can Fix CER937

You must be a Certinia Admin (or have permission to manage integrations in Certinia) to resolve this error.

## How to Update the Expensify Integration in Certinia

1. Log in to Certinia as an administrator.
2. Locate the **Expensify Integration** within Certinia.
3. Select the option to **Update** the integration configuration.
4. If Certinia prompts you to reinstall or upgrade the Expensify package or metadata, follow the on-screen instructions.
5. Confirm any API credentials or OAuth tokens are refreshed during the process.
6. Save your changes.

If Certinia does not show an update option, contact your Certinia support team or system administrator to confirm access to the latest integration updates. Certinia releases integration updates periodically and may require administrative approval before installation.

# FAQ

## Does CER937 mean I need to reconnect Certinia?

No. In most cases, updating the integration in Certinia and selecting **Sync Now** resolves the issue.

---

## Is CER937 caused by Expensify settings?

No. CER937 is triggered when Certinia requires an integration update. Your Expensify Workspace settings are not the cause.

---

## Do I need both a Certinia Admin and a Workspace Admin?

Typically:
- A Certinia Admin updates the integration.
- A Workspace Admin re-syncs the connection in Expensify.

In some organizations, the same person manages both roles.
