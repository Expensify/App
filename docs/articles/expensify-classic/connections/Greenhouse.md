description: Automatically send candidates from Greenhouse to Expensify for easy reimbursement

# Overview
Expensify's direct integration with Greenhouse allows you to automatically send candidates from Greenhouse to Expensify for easy reimbursement. The integration can set the candidate's recruiter or recruiting coordinator as approver in Expensify.

## Prerequisites of the integration
- You must be a Workspace Admin in Expensify and an Admin in Greenhouse with Developer Permissions to complete this connection. This can be the same person or two different people.
- Each Greenhouse candidate record must have an email address in order to send to Expensify since we use this as the unique identifier in Expensify.
- We highly recommend that you create a specific Expensify workspace for candidates so that you can set up a separate workflow and a different set of Categories and Tags from what your employees would see.

3. Optionally select the Recruiter field to set the recruiter as the candidate's expense approver in Expensify (Note: if you'd prefer to have the Recruiting Coordinator used as the default approver, please reach out to concierge@expensify.com or your account manager to request that we change the default approver on your behalf)
