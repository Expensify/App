## ExpensiError XRO014: Billable Expenses Require a Customer

### Why does this happen?
Xero requires all billable expenses exported from Expensify to have a customer assigned. This error occurs when one or more expenses are marked "billable" but lack an associated customer.

### How to fix it
1. Navigate to **Settings > Workspaces > [workspace] > Connections > Configure > Coding tab**.
2. Enable **Billable Expenses** by toggling the setting.
3. Click **Save** to sync the connection.
4. Open the report and apply a **Customer** tag to each billable expense.
   - *Note: A Xero Contact becomes a Customer only after an invoice has been raised against them. If the Customer is missing, create a dummy invoice in Xero, then delete/void it and sync again.*
5. Retry the export by clicking **Export to > Xero**.

2. Locate and open the report with the error.
3. Click on the blue **Payment** link.
4. Click **Options > Remove and Redo** (*Do not void the bill*).
5. In Expensify, open the report and click **Export to > Xero**.
   - The new export will override the previous report while retaining the same ID.

2. Select a **Xero Bank Account** for non-reimbursable expenses.

## Why Are Company Card Expenses Exported to the Wrong Account?

1. Confirm that **company cards** are mapped correctly:
   - **Settings > Domains > Company Cards > Edit Export**.
2. Verify that expenses have the **Card+Lock icon** (indicating they were imported from a company card).
3. Ensure the exporter is a **Domain Admin**:
   - Check the **Preferred Exporter** setting under **Settings > Workspaces > Connections > Configure**.
4. Verify company card mapping under the correct workspace.

## Why Do Non-Reimbursable Expenses Show 'Credit Card Misc' Instead of the Merchant?

If a merchant in Expensify **matches** a contact in Xero, expenses will reflect the vendor name. Otherwise, they default to \"Expensify Credit Card Misc\" to prevent duplicates.

### How to fix it
Use **Expense Rules** in Expensify to standardize merchant names. Learn more [here](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/expenses/Create-Expense-Rules).
