## I use a Cashbook or Ledger Xero account, can I still connect in Expensify?

Starting in September 2021, there’s a chance for Cashbook and Ledger-type organizations in Xero. Apps like Expensify won’t be able to create invoices and bills for these accounts using the Xero API. So, if you’re using a Cashbook or Ledger Xero account, please be aware that this might affect your Expensify integration.
