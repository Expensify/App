# Google Apps SSO Integration

## Overview
Expensify offers **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration with [Google Apps](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/identity/single-sign-on), allowing **one-click Workspace invites** for easier user management.

### Requirements:
- You must be an **admin** of a **Group Workspace** with a **Collect or Control** subscription.
- You must have **Administrator access** to the Google Apps Admin console.

> **Note:** Google Apps SSO is different from using Google as an Identity Provider for **SAML SSO**, which restricts domain access. If you need **Google SAML SSO**, follow [Googleâ€™s guide](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7371682). You can enable both simultaneously.
