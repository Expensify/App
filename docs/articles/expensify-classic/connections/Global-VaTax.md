# Global VaTax Integration

The Expensify-Global VaTax integration helps businesses reclaim Value Added Tax (VAT) on international expenses. If your company is based in the U.S. but conducts business abroad, you can track expenses in [Expensify](https://use.expensify.com/expense-management) and sync them with [Global VaTax](https://globalvatax.com/) to simplify VAT recovery.

## What is VAT?

[Value Added Tax (VAT)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueaddedtax.asp#:~:text=Value%2Dadded%20tax%20(VAT)%20is%20a%20flat%20tax%20levied,different%20parties%20to%20a%20transaction.) is a consumption tax applied to goods and services in many countries. It is automatically included in purchases, but businesses traveling internationally may be eligible for VAT refunds.

### VAT-Recoverable Expenses

Businesses can reclaim VAT on various expenses, including:

- Hotels and lodging  
- Business entertainment  
- Conferences and trade shows  
- Legal and marketing fees  
- DDP shipping and storage fees  
- Aviation-related expenses  
- Other qualifying international business expenses  

## How VAT Refunds Work

VAT refund regulations vary by country and expense type, making the process complex. Global VaTax simplifies this by handling:

- VAT analysis and calculation  
- Expense classification based on VAT eligibility  
- Report preparation and submission to tax authorities  

By syncing Expensify with Global VaTax, businesses can automate VAT reporting and reclaim eligible expenses efficiently.
