Expensify’s receipt integrations allow merchants to automatically send receipts directly to a member’s Expensify account. When a merchant emails a receipt to a member and Cc's **receipts@expensify.com**, Expensify creates a transaction in the account of the email recipient.

You can integrate receipts using Expensify’s **pre-built integrations** or by setting up a **custom receipt integration**.

# Use a Pre-Built Travel Integration

Expensify offers pre-built integrations with **Bolt Work, SpotHero, Grab, and KAYAK for Business** to automate travel receipt imports.

## Bolt Work

1. Open the **Bolt** app and tap the **menu icon** in the top left.
2. Tap **Work trips** > **Create profile**.
3. Enter the email associated with Expensify, then tap **Next**.

8. Tap **Verify**.
9. Return to **Work trips** from the menu.
10. Tap **Add expense provider** and select **Expensify** again.

**Important:** When booking a trip with Bolt Work, select your **work trip profile** as the payment method. This ensures the receipt is automatically sent to Expensify.

## SpotHero

1. Open the **SpotHero** app and tap the **menu icon** in the top left.

# Build Your Own Receipt Integration  

1. Email **receiptintegration@expensify.com** with the following details:
   - **Subject:** "Receipt Integration Request"
   - **Body:** A list of email addresses from which the merchant sends receipts.
2. Within **two weeks**, you'll receive confirmation that the email addresses are whitelisted.
3. Once confirmed, Cc **receipts@expensify.com** when sending receipt emails to members.
4. Test the integration:
   - Send a receipt email to your Expensify email and Cc **receipts@expensify.com**.
   - Wait for SmartScan to process it.
   - Check that the merchant, date, and amount are correctly added to the transaction.

## Using the Integration  

When emailing a receipt:

- **Attach the receipt** as the only attachment (unless it's an .ics file).
- **Include only one email address** in the **To** field.
- **Cc only** `receipts@expensify.com`.
- **Hotel and car rental reservations** cannot be sent as expenses because payment occurs at checkout.
- **Use standardized currency codes** (ISO 4217) where applicable.

# FAQ  

## Why don’t I see the “Send to Expensify” option in Trainline?  

This may occur if the native iOS Mail app is not installed. You can still use the **Share to Expensify** function in iOS for Trainline receipts.

## Why does it take two weeks to set up a custom integration?  

Receipt integrations require **manual setup by Expensify engineers**, which takes up to two weeks.

## Can I connect via API instead of email?  

No, Expensify does not currently offer API-based receipt integrations. All integrations must be set up via email.

## What is Expensify’s Open API used for?  

Expensify’s Open API is designed for **exporting** data to external accounting systems. **Receipt imports must be done via email integration**.

## Can Expensify split one email into multiple receipts?  

No, but after SmartScan processes the receipt, you can **[split the expense](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/expenses/Split-an-expense)** manually.

## Can we set up a co-marketing partnership with Expensify?  

No, Expensify does not offer co-marketing partnerships at this time.

## Can we promote our custom Expensify integration?  

Yes! You can promote your integration on your **website** and **social media** (tag **@Expensify** and use the **#Expensify** hashtag). Consider adding:
- A brief **overview** of how the integration works.
- Key **benefits** of using it.
- A **setup guide**.
- Contact details for **integration support**.
