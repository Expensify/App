# Why Are Company Card Expenses Exporting to the Wrong Account?

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Incorrect Card Mapping:**  
   - Confirm that company cards are correctly mapped in **Settings > Domains > Company Cards**.
   - Click **Edit Export** for the card to check its assigned account.

2. **Expense Source:**  
   - Expenses imported directly from a company card (marked with a **Card+Lock** icon) follow domain mapping settings.
   - Expenses created via **SmartScan** or manually as **cash expenses** export to the **default bank account**.

3. **Exporter Must Be a Domain Admin:**  
   - Verify that the person exporting the report is a **Domain Admin**.
   - If reports export automatically via Concierge, the **Preferred Exporter** in **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Accounting > Configure** must be a **Domain Admin**.

4. **Workspace Selection:**  
   - If multiple workspaces are connected to QuickBooks Online, ensure the correct one is selected.  
     - Each workspace has a separate list of export accounts.
