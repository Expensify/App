The Expensify integration with QuickBooks Online brings in your expense accounts and other data and even exports reports directly to QuickBooks for easy reconciliation. Plus, with advanced features in QuickBooks Online, you can fine-tune coding settings in Expensify for automated data export to optimize your accounting workflow.

## Before connecting

It’s crucial to understand the requirements based on your specific QuickBooks subscription:
- While all the features are available in Expensify, their accessibility may vary depending on your QuickBooks Online subscription.
- An error will occur if you try to export to QuickBooks Online with a feature enabled that isn’t part of your subscription.
- Please be aware that Expensify does not support the Self-Employed subscription in QuickBooks Online.
