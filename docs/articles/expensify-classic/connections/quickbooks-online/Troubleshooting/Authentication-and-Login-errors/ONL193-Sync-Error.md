# ONL193 Sync Error: Couldn’t Connect to QuickBooks Online

If you see the error:

**“ONL193 Sync Error: Couldn’t connect to QuickBooks Online. Please reenter your admin login credentials.”**

this means the QuickBooks Online credentials originally used to establish the connection have changed or are no longer valid.

Until the connection is reauthenticated, syncing and exports will fail.

---

## Why ONL193 Happens

ONL193 occurs when:

- The QuickBooks Online admin password was changed.
- The QuickBooks Online admin user was removed or updated.
- The authentication token expired.
- A new admin account replaced the original connection account.

When this happens, Expensify can no longer authenticate with QuickBooks Online and requires reconnection.

This is a QuickBooks Online credential issue — not an Expensify Workspace configuration issue.

## Who Can Fix ONL193

You must be a **Workspace Admin** in Expensify and have **Admin credentials in QuickBooks Online** to reconnect the integration.

## How to Confirm ONL193 Is Resolved

If the error continues, confirm you are using a QuickBooks Online Admin account and that the credentials are correct.

# FAQ

## Does ONL193 mean my reports were deleted?

No. Your reports remain in Expensify. The sync failed due to invalid or expired QuickBooks Online credentials.

---

## Do I need to disconnect QuickBooks Online first?

No. Selecting **Reconnect** from the Sync window is typically sufficient.

---

## Will reconnecting change my accounting mappings?

If you reconnect with the same admin credentials, your settings usually remain unchanged. If using new credentials, you may need to reconfigure categories, accounts, and tags.
