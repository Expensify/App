# The Web Connector Cannot Be Reached

These errors indicate a connection issue between Expensify and QuickBooks.

## How to Resolve

1. Ensure both the Web Connector and QuickBooks Desktop are running.
2. Verify that the Web Connector is installed in the same location as QuickBooks:
   - If QuickBooks is on your local desktop, the Web Connector should be too.
   - If QuickBooks is on a remote server, install the Web Connector there as well.

If the error persists:

1. Close the Web Connector completely using Task Manager if needed.
2. Right-click the Web Connector icon and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Sync your Workspace again.

Final troubleshooting steps:

1. Restart QuickBooks Desktop.
2. In Expensify, go to **Settings** > **Workspaces**.
3. Select the connected Workspace.
4. Click the **Connections** tab and select **QuickBooks Desktop**.
5. Click **Sync Now**.
6. If the issue persists, reinstall the Web Connector.

3. Close any open dialogue boxes in QuickBooks that may interfere with syncing.
