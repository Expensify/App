## What types of accounts can be imported from QuickBooks Desktop?

| QuickBooks Desktop Account Type  | How it Imports to Expensify |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Accounts Payable           | Vendor bill or journal entry    |
| Accounts Receivable        | Not imported                    |
| Bank                       | Debit card or check             |
| Credit Card                | Credit card export options      |
| Fixed Assets               | Categories                      |
| Other Current Assets       | Categories or journal entry     |
| Other Current Liabilities  | Journal entry (if report creator is an Employee) |
| Other Expense              | All detail types import except Exchange Gain/Loss |

## Why are exports showing as "Credit Card Misc."?
Expensify checks for an exact vendor match when exporting credit or debit card expenses. If no match is found, expenses are mapped to a "Credit Card Misc." vendor.

To export expenses to a specific QuickBooks account:
1. In Expensify, go to **Settings** > **Domains**.
2. Select the desired domain.
3. Click the **Company Cards** tab.
4. Click **Export**.

## How does multi-currency work with QuickBooks Desktop?

- **Vendor Bills and Checks**: The vendor and account currencies must match but do not need to be in the home currency.
- **Credit Card**: If a matching vendor is not found, the expense exports to the "Credit Card Misc." vendor. Foreign currency transactions are converted 1:1.
- **Journal Entries**: Multi-currency exports fail unless the account, vendor, and home currency match.
