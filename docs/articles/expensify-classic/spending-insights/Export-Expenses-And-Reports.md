# FAQ

## Can I export one line per report?
No, custom templates export one line per **expense**, not per report.

## Can I export from the mobile app?
No, exports are only available on the **web app**.

## How do I print a report?
1. Click the **Reports** tab.
2. Open a report.
3. Click **Details** in the top right of the report.
4. Click the Print icon.

## Why isn’t my report exporting?
If your report has many expenses with high-resolution images, the PDF download may fail. Try splitting it into smaller reports. A report must have at least one expense to be exported or saved as a PDF.

## Can I download multiple PDFs at once?
No, you must download reports individually. Use **CSV export** if you need multiple reports in one file.

## The data exported to Excel is showing incorrectly. How can I fix this?
When you open a CSV file from Expensify in Excel, report and transaction IDs may appear in exponential format if they’re too long. To fix this, import the CSV instead of opening it directly:

1. Open Excel and click **File > Import**.
2. Select your CSV file and follow the prompts.
3. Set the report ID or transaction ID column to **Text format**.

## Why do the numbers in my exported file look incorrect?
If numbers are displayed in scientific notation (e.g., `1.79e+308`), switch your spreadsheet program to **Plain Text** or **Number** format.

## Why are leading zeros missing in my export?
Excel may automatically remove leading zeros. To prevent this:
1. Open Excel and click **File > Import**.
2. Select your CSV file.
3. In step 3, set relevant columns to **Text format**.
