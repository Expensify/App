description: How to export expenses and reports using custom reports, PDF files, CSVs, and more 
---

There are several methods you can use to export your expenses and reports, including:
- Export as a PDF
- Export as a CSV or to an accounting integration
- Export using a default or custom export template

# Export PDF

1. Click the **Reports** tab.
2. Open a report.
3. Click **Details** in the top right of the report.
4. Click the download icon.

The PDF will be downloaded with all expenses, any attached receipts, and all report notes.

# Export CSV or apply a template

1. Click either the **Expenses** or **Reports** tab.
2. On the left hand side, select the expenses/reports you’d like to export.
3. Click **Export to** at the top right of the page.
4. Choose the desired export option. You can use one of the default templates below, or you can create your own template. *Note: The default templates and the option to export to a connected accounting package are only available on the Reports page.*
   - **All Data - Expense Level Export**: Prints a line for each expense with all of the data associated with the expenses. This is useful if you want to see all of the data stored in Expensify for each expense.
   - **All Data - Report Level Export**: Prints a line per report, giving a summary of the report data.
   - **Basic Export**: A simpler expense-level export of the data visible on the PDF report. Includes basics such as date, amount, merchant, category, tag, reimbursable state, description, receipt URL, and original expense currency and amount.
   - **Canadian Multiple Tax Export**: Exports a line per expense with all available information on the taxes applied to the expenses on your report(s). This is useful if you need to see the tax spend.
   - **Category Export**: Exports category names with the total amount attributed to each category on the report. While you can also access this information on the Insights page, it can be convenient to export to a CSV to run further analysis in your favorite spreadsheet program.
   - **Per Diem Export**: Exports basic expense details for only the per diem expenses on the report. Useful for reviewing employee Per Diem spend.
   - **Tag Export**: Exports tag names into columns with the total amount attributed to each tag on the report.

# Create custom export templates

If you don't have a direct connection to your accounting system, you can export your expense data to the system for upload as long as the system accepts a CSV file. You can then analyze the data in your favorite spreadsheet program. 

Custom export templates can be created and made available to all Workspace Admins for your workspace, or you can create a template that is just for your own use.

### Date formats

| M/dd/yyyy | 5/23/2019| 
|MMMM dd, yyyy| May 23, 2019| 
|dd MMM yyyy| 23 May 2019|

### Math formulas

| Formula | Description |
| -- | -- |
| * |  Multiplication {math: 3 * 4} output 12| 
| / |  Division {math: 3 / 4 }output 0.75| 
| + |  Addition {math: 3 + 4 }output | 
| - |  Subtraction {math: 3 - 4 }output -1| 
| ^ |  Exponent {math: 3 ^ 4 } output 81| 
| sqrt |  The square root of a number. {sqrt:64} output 8| 
|| Note - You can also combine the value of any two numeric fields. For example, you can use {math: {expense:tag:glcode} + {expense:category:glcode}} to add the value of the Tag GL code with the Category GL code.|

### Substring formulas 

This formula will output a subset of the string in question. It is important to remember that the count starts at 0 not 1.

`{expense:merchant|substr:0:4}` would output "Star" for a merchant named Starbucks. This is because we are telling it to start at position 0 and be of 4 character length. 

`{expense:merchant|substr:4:5}` would output "bucks" for a merchant named Starbucks. This is because we are telling it to start at position 4 and be of 5 character length.

**Can I export one line per report?**

No, the custom template always exports one line per *expense*. At the moment, it is not possible to create a template that will export one line per report.

**How do I print a report?**

1. Click the **Reports** tab.
2. Open a report.
3. Click **Details** in the top right of the report.
4. Click the Print icon.

**Why isn’t my report exporting?**

Big reports with a lot of expenses may cause the PDF download to fail due to images with large resolutions. In that case, try breaking the report into multiple smaller reports. A report must have at least one expense to be exported or saved as a PDF.

**Can I download multiple PDFs at once?**

No, you can’t download multiple reports as PDFs at the same time. If you’d like to export multiple reports, an alternative to consider is the CSV export option.

**The data exported to Excel is showing incorrectly. How can I fix this?**

When opening a CSV file export from Expensify in Excel, it’ll automatically register report IDs and transaction IDs as numbers and assign the number format to the report ID column. If a number is greater than a certain length, Excel will contract the number and display it in exponential form. To prevent this, the number needs to be imported as text, which can be done by opening Excel and clicking File > Import > select your CSV file. Follow the prompts, then on step 3, set the report ID/transactionID column to import as Text.

**Why are my numbers exporting in a weird format?**

Do your numbers look something like this: 1.7976931348623157e+308? This means that your spreadsheet program is formatting long numbers in an exponential or scientific format. If that happens, you can correct it by changing the data to Plain Text or a Number in your spreadsheet program.

**Why are my leading zeros missing?**

Is the export showing “1” instead of “01”? This means that your spreadsheet program is cutting off the leading zero. This is a common issue with viewing exported data in Excel. Unfortunately, we don’t have a good solution for this. We recommend checking your spreadsheet program’s help documents for formatting suggestions.
