## Can I share my custom export report? 

If you would like to create a custom export report that can be shared with other workspace admins, you can do so by navigating to the **[Settings > Workspaces > Group > [Workspace Name] > Export Formats** page. Custom export reports created under the **Settings > Account > Preferences** page are only available to the member who created them.

## Can I put expenses from different workspaces on the same report? 

Custom export reports created under the **Settings > Account > Preferences** page can export expenses from multiple workspaces. 

Custom export formats created under **Settings > Workspaces> Group > [Workspace Name] > Export Formats** are for expenses reported under that workspace only. 

## Are there any default export reports available?

Yes! We have [seven default reports](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/spending-insights/Default-Export-Templates) available to export directly from the Reports page: 

- **All Data — Expense Level Export**: Use this to view all of the details from their expense reports (tax, merchant category codes, approvals, etc.)
- **All Data—Report Level Export**: This report is great if you don't need to see each individual expense but want to see a line-by-line breakdown at a report level (submitter, total amount, report ID, etc.)
- **Basic Export**: The best way to get a simple breakdown of all your expenses
- **Canadian Multiple Tax Export**: To gain a better understanding of the various Canadian taxes tied to expenses (GST, PST, etc.)
- **Category Export**: Use this to see a breakdown of your expenses by Category
- **Per Diem Export**: Use to export your Per Diem details
- **Tag Export**: Similar to the Category Export, but for Tags

*These reports will be emailed directly to your email address rather than automatically downloaded.* 

## How many expenses can I export in one report? 
The custom export reports are best for small-to-medium chunks of data. If you want to export large amounts of data, we recommend you use a [default export report](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/spending-insights/Default-Export-Templates) that you can run from the Reports page.
