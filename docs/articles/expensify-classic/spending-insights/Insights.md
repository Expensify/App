#### Can I share my custom export report? 

If you would like to create a custom export report that can be shared with other workspace admins, you can do so by navigating to the **[Settings > Workspaces > Group > [Workspace Name] > Export Formats** page. Custom export reports created under the **Settings > Account > Preferences** page are only available to the member who created them.

#### Can I put expenses from different workspaces on the same report? 

Custom export reports created under the Settings > Account > Preferences page can export expenses from multiple workspaces, and custom export formats created under Settings > Workspaces> Group > [Workspace Name] > Export Formats are for expenses reported under that workspace only. 

#### Are there any default export reports available?

Yes! We have [seven default reports](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/spending-insights/Default-Export-Templates) available to export directly from the Reports page: 

- **All Data** - Expense Level Export** - the name says it all! This is for the people who want ALL the details from their expense reports. We're talking Tax, Merchant Category Codes, Approvers - you name it, this report's got it!
- **All Data** - Report Level Export - this is the report for those who don't need to see each individual expense but want to see a line-by-line breakdown at a report level - submitter, total amount, report ID - that kind of stuff
- **Basic Export** - this is the best way to get a simple breakdown of all your expenses - just the basics
- **Canadian Multiple Tax Export** - tax, GST, PST...if you need to know tax then this is the export you want!
- **Category Export** - want to see a breakdown of your expenses by Category? This is the export you
- **Per Diem Export** - the name says it all
- **Tag Export** - much like the Category Export, but for Tags

*These reports will be emailed directly to your email address rather than automatically downloaded.* 

#### How many expenses can I export in one report? 
The custom export reports are best for small-to-medium chunks of data. If you want to export large amounts of data, we recommend you use a [default export report](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/spending-insights/Default-Export-Templates) that you can run from the Reports page.
