After connecting or importing your company cards to Expensify, you can assign each card to its respective cardholder. 

1. Hover over **Settings** and click **Domains**. 
2. Select the desired domain.
3. Click the card dropdown menu and select the desired feed from the list.
4. Click **Assign New Cards** to populate the emails and the last four digits of the cardholder. 

![Under the Company Cards tab on the left, you'll use the dropdown menu to select a card and beneath that, you'll click Assign New Cards]({{site.url}}/assets/images/CompanyCards_Assign.png){:width="100%"}
{:start="5"}

5. Select the cardholder.
6. Enter or select the employee's email address. *Note: Employees must have an email address under this domain in order to assign a card to them.*
![Below the Assign a Card header, enter or select the employee's email address]({{site.url}}/assets/images/CompanyCards_EmailAssign.png){:width="100%"}
{:start="8"}

8. Select the last four digits of the card number.
9. (Optional) Select the transaction start date, if desired.
10. Click **Assign**.
11. Select the card. You can search the list using the last 4 digits of the card number.
   - If no transactions have posted on the card, the card number will not appear in the list. Instead, you can assign the card by typing in the full card number in the field and pressing ENTER on your keyboard. The field may clear itself after you press ENTER.*

# Unassign company cards

To unassign a specific card, click the Actions button to the right of the card and click **Unassign**.

![Click the Actions button to the right of the card and select Unassign.]({{site.url}}/assets/images/CompanyCards_Unassign.png){:width="100%"}

To completely remove the card connection, unassign every card from the list and then refresh the page.

*Note: If expenses are Processing and then rejected, they will also be deleted when they're returned to an Open state, as the card they're linked to no longer exists.*

**My Commercial Card Feed is set up. Why is a specific card not coming up when I try to assign it to an employee?**

Cards will appear in the dropdown when they are activated and have at least one posted transaction. If the card is activated and has been used for a while and you're still not seeing it, reach out to your Account Manager or message concierge@expensify.com for further assistance.
