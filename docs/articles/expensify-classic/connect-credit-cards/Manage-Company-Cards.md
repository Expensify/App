# Key Concepts

## Direct Bank Connections
A direct bank connection links Expensify to your bank for automatic transaction imports.

- **Supported Banks**: Includes major institutions like Chase, Amex, Citibank, Wells Fargo, and others.
- **Credentials**: Requires master administrative login credentials.
- **Import History**: Banks typically provide 30-90 days of historical transactions.
- **Troubleshooting**: If your connection fails, ensure your bank login credentials are correct and security questions are up to date. Disable two-factor authentication temporarily if necessary, as Expensify cannot bypass it. Use the "Fix Card" option in **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Company Cards** to resolve issues.

## Commercial Card Feed
A commercial card feed is a direct connection between Expensify and your bank for reliable daily transaction imports.

- **Supported Networks**: Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.
- **Setup**: Initiated by your bank and configured in Expensify.
- **Advantages**: More stable and not affected by changes to login credentials.
- **Deep Dive**: For Mastercard, use the Common Data File (CDF) format; for Visa, enable the Variant Call Format (VCF). American Express requires specific forms. Ensure you provide accurate distribution IDs and start dates during setup to avoid data gaps.

## CSV Upload
A CSV upload is a manual method for importing credit card transactions into Expensify.

- **File Formats**: Accepts CSV, OFX, QFX, or XLS files.
- **Minimum Required Fields**: Includes card number, date, merchant, amount, and currency.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for unsupported banks or importing older transactions.
- **Common Issues**: If you encounter errors such as "Attribute value mapping is missing," ensure all required fields are included and formatted correctly. Use Expensify’s [CSV template](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/concierge-responses-expensify-com/uploads%2F1594908368712-Best+Example+CSV+for+Domains.csv) as a guide.

# FAQ

## Missing Transactions: Why aren’t all transactions appearing?
Transactions may take up to 24 hours to post. Update the card feed or check the Reconciliation Dashboard to review transaction data.

- **Reconciliation Dashboard**: Navigate to **Settings > Domains > [Domain Name] > Company Cards > Reconciliation** to identify missing or unapproved expenses within a specific timeframe.
- **Common Issues**: Ensure the transaction date range is correct. If gaps persist, contact Concierge to request a historical data update.

## Direct vs. Commercial Feeds: Which option is better?
Commercial feeds are more stable and reliable but require setup by your bank. Direct connections are easier to set up but may experience occasional disruptions.

## CSV Upload Errors: What should I do if my upload fails?
Ensure the file includes the required fields and matches the formatting guidelines. Use Expensify’s [CSV template](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/concierge-responses-expensify-com/uploads%2F1594908368712-Best+Example+CSV+for+Domains.csv) for reference.

## Unassigning Cards: What happens when I unassign a card?
Unassigning a card deletes all open or unreported expenses linked to it. Submitted or processed expenses remain unaffected.

## Connection Issues: Why is my card connection broken?
Check for changes to bank credentials, security questions, or login details. Update the information in Expensify and re-establish the connection via **Fix Card**.

## Historical Data: How far back can I import transactions?
Most banks provide 30-90 days of historical data. Older transactions can be imported using the CSV upload method.
