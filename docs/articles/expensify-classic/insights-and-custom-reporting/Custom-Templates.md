# Overview

If you  don't have a direct connection to your accounting system, as long as the system accepts a CSV file, you can easily export your expense data for upload to the system. Custom templates are great if you want to analyze the data in your favorite spreadsheet program. 

# How to use custom templates
If you are a Group workspace admin you can create a custom template that will be available to all Workspace Admins on the workspace from **Settings > Workspaces > Group > _Workspace Name_ > Export Formats**.

If you are using a free account you can create a custom template from **Settings > Account > Preferences > CSV Export Formats**. 

You can use your custom templates from the **Reports** page. 
1. Select the checkbox next to the report you’d like to export
3. Click **Export to** at the top of the page
4. Select your template from the dropdown

| * |  Multiplication {math: 3 * 4} output 12| 
| / |  Division {math: 3 / 4 }output 0.75|

## Substring formulas 
This formula will output a subset of the string in question. It is important to remember that the count starts at 0 not 1.

`{expense:merchant|substr:0:4}` would output "Star" for a merchant named Starbucks. This is because we are telling it to start at position 0 and be of 4 character length. 

`{expense:merchant|substr:4:5}` would output "bucks" for a merchant named Starbucks. This is because we are telling it to start at position 4 and be of 5 character length.
