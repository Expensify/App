# How to add an Australian business bank account (for admins)
A withdrawal account is the business bank account that you want to use to pay your employee reimbursements. 

_Your policy currency must be set to AUD and reimbursement setting set to Indirect to continue. If your main policy is used for something other than AUD, then you will need to create a new one and set that policy to AUD._ 

To set this up, you’ll run through the following steps:

1. Go to **Settings > Your Account > Payments** and click **Add Verified Bank Account**
![Click the Verified Bank Account button in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen](https://help.expensify.com/assets/images/add-vba-australian-account.png){:width="100%"}

2. Enter the required information to connect to your business bank account. If you don't know your Bank User ID/Direct Entry ID/APCA Number, please contact your bank and they will be able to provide this.

3. Link the withdrawal account to your policy by heading to **Settings > Policies > Group > [Policy name] > Reimbursement**
4. Click **Direct reimbursement**
5. Set the default withdrawal account for processing reimbursements 
6. Tell your employees to add their deposit accounts and start reimbursing. 

# How to delete a bank account
If you’re no longer using a bank account you previously connected to Expensify, you can delete it by doing the following:

1. Navigate to Settings > Accounts > Payments 
2. Click **Delete** 
![Click the Delete button](https://help.expensify.com/assets/images/delete-australian-bank-account.png){:width="100%"}

You can complete this process either via the web app (on a computer), or via the mobile app.

If you are unsure, please check with your bank to ensure whether to tick this option or not, as selecting an incorrect option will result in the ABA file not working with your bank's internet banking platform.

If you have employees in other countries outside of Australia, you can now reimburse them directly using Global Reimbursement. 

To do this, you’ll first need to delete any existing Australian business bank accounts. Then, you’ll want to follow the instructions to enable Global Reimbursements
