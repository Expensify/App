# FAQ  

## **What happens if my bank requires an additional security check before adding it to a third-party?**  

If your bank account has 2FA enabled or another security step, you should be prompted to complete this when adding the account. If not, and you encounter an error, you can always select the option to “Connect Manually”. Either way, please double check that you are entering the correct bank account details to ensure successful payments.  

## **What if I also want to pay employees with my business bank account?**  

If you’ve added a business deposit-only account and also wish to also pay employees, vendors, or utilize the Expensify Card with this bank account, select “Verify” on the listed bank account. This will take you through the additional verification steps to use this account to issue payments.  

## **I connected my deposit-only bank account – Why haven’t I received my reimbursement?**  

There are a few reasons a reimbursement may be unsuccessful. The first step is to review the estimated deposit date on the report. If it’s after that date and you still haven’t seen the funds, it could have been unsuccessful because:
    - The incorrect account was added. If you believe you may have entered the wrong account, please reach out to Concierge and provide the Report ID for the missing reimbursement.
    - Your account wasn’t set up for Direct Deposit/ACH. You may want to contact your bank to confirm. 

If you aren’t sure, please reach out to Concierge and we can assist!
