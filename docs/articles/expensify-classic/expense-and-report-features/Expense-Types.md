# Overview
Expense types help categorize different expenses for better financial management. While reimbursable and non-reimbursable expenses are common, Expensify offers various other options to suit your needs. Let's explore the available expense types.

# How To
## Filtering a Report by Expense Type
Organizing a report by expense type can make it easier to review expenses on a report. 
- Open the report you're interested in.
- Click the **Details** icon in the upper right corner of the report,
- Change the “View” to **Detailed** and “Split by” **Reimbursable** or **Billable**.
- You’ll also see the option to **Group by Category** or **Tags**. 


# Deep Dive
Each report will show the total amount for all expenses in the upper right. Under that total, there will be a breakdown of amounts that are reimbursable, billable, and non-reimbursable (depending on which of those expense types exist on the report). 

## Expense Types
- **Reimbursable Expenses:** Employees pay for these expenses out of their pockets on behalf of the business and are usually reimbursed. They often come from cash, debit cards, or personal credit card purchases.
- **Non-reimbursable Expenses:** The business directly covers these expenses, so there's no need to reimburse the employee. Typically, these expenses are company card expenses.
- **Billable Expenses:** Business or employee expenses must be billed to a specific client or vendor. Choose this option if you need to track expenses for invoicing to customers, clients, or other departments.
- **Per Diem Expenses:** These expenses involve a daily or partial daily rate you can configure in your expense Workspace.
- **Time Expenses:** Employees or jobs are billed based on an hourly rate that you can set within Expensify.
- **Distance Expenses:** These expenses are related to travel for work.

# FAQ

## What’s the difference between a receipt, an expense, and a report attachment?

- **Expense:** Created when you SmartScan or manually upload a receipt from a purchase.
- **Receipt:** Automatically attached to the expense during the SmartScan process.
- **Report Attachments:** Additional documents that need to be submitted to your approver (e.g., supplemental documents to the purchase) can be added to a report anytime by clicking the paperclip icon in the Reports Comments. 

## How are credits or refunds displayed in Expensify?
In Expensify, a credit is displayed as an expense with a minus (ex. -$1.00) in front of it. That’s because Expensify defaults all expenses as something that needs to be paid by the company. So a credit that is returned to the company is displayed as a negative expense. 

If a report includes a credit or a refund expense, it will offset the total amount on the report. 
For example, the report has two reimbursable expenses, $400 and $500. The total Reimbursable is $900. 
Conversely, a -$400 and $500 will be a total Reimbursable amount of $500
