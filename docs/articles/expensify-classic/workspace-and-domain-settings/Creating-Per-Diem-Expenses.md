# Overview

What are Per Diems? Per diems, short for "per diem allowance" or "daily allowance," are fixed daily payments provided by your employer to cover expenses incurred during business or work-related travel. These allowances simplify expense tracking and reimbursement for meals, lodging, and incidental expenses during a trip. Per Diems can be masterfully tracked in Expensify! 

## How To create per diem expenses 

To add per diem expenses, you need three pieces of information:
1. Where did you go? - Specify your travel destination.
2. How long were you away? - Define the period you're claiming for.
3. Which rate did you use? - Select the appropriate per diem rate.

### Step 1: On either the web or mobile app, click New Expense and choose Per Diem

### Step 2: Select your travel destination from the Destination dropdown
If your trip involves multiple stops, create a separate Per Diem expense for each destination. Remember, the times are relative to your home city.

### Step 3: Select your Start date, End date, Start time, and End time
Expensify will automatically calculate the duration of your trip. We'll show you a breakdown of your days: the time between departure and midnight on the first day, the total days in between, and the time between midnight and your return time on the last day.

### Step 4: Select a Subrate based on the trip duration from the dropdown list
You can include meal deductions or overnight lodging costs if your jurisdiction permits.

### Step 5: Enter any other required coding and click “Save”

### Step 6: Submit for Approval
Finally, submit your Per Diem expense for approval, and you'll be on your way to getting reimbursed!
