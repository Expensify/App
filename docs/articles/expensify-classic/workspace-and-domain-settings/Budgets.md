## Can I import budgets as a CSV? 
At this time, you cannot import budgets via CSV.

## When will I be notified as a budget is hit?
Notifications are sent twice: 
   - When your notification threshold is hit (i.e, if you set this as 50%, you’ll be notified when 50% of the budget is met)
   - When 100% of the budget is met 

## How will I be notified when a budget is hit?
A message will be sent in the  #admins room of the Workspace.
