Many Expensify customers have one person managing key roles in Expensify Classic: **Billing Owner, Workspace Admin, Domain Admin, Technical Contact,** and **Bank Account Owner**. If this person leaves the company or changes roles, their responsibilities must be reassigned to another employee.

⚠️ **Important:** Before the current admin leaves, they and the new admin should complete the following checklist.

# Checklist for the Current Admin

## Assign a New Admin

1. [Add the new admin](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Invite-members-and-assign-roles) to the workspace.
2. [Assign the Admin role](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Change-member-workspace-roles) to the new admin.
3. If your company uses **company card feeds, Expensify Cards, domain groups,** or **SAML**, invite the new admin as a [Domain Admin](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Add-Domain-Members-and-Admins).

**The current admin must add the new admin to all company workspaces, including ones that are no longer active:**
- The new admin must take ownership of **all company workspaces** to ensure a single **Annual Subscription** continues.
- If the previous admin retains ownership of any workspace, they will continue being billed separately.

## Share Access to the Company Bank Account
