Reimbursing employees in Expensify is quick, easy, and completely free. Let Expensify do the tedious work for you by taking advantage of the features available to automate employee reimbursement. 

# Configure a Workspace's Reimbursement Settings
There are a few ways to reimburse employees in Expensify. The option that's best suited for you and your business will depend on a few different factors:
- **Direct Reimbursement**: For companies with a business bank account located in the US that reimburse employees within the US.
- **Indirect Reimbursement**: This option is available to all members, and connecting a bank account to Expensify is not required. Indirect reimbursement indicates that all reports are reimbursed outside of Expensify. 
- **Global Reimbursement**: If your companyâ€™s business bank account is in the US, Canada, the UK, Europe, or Australia, you can reimburse employees directly in nearly any country worldwide.

## Set Up Direct Reimbursement 

Once a [business bank account is connected to Expensify](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/Business-Bank-Accounts-USD#how-to-add-a-verified-business-bank-account), a workspace admin can enable indirect reimbursement via **Settings > Workspaces > Workspace Name > Reimbursement > Direct**.

#### Additional features available with Direct Reimbursement:
- **Select a default reimburser for the Workspace from the dropdown menu**:
     - The default reimburser will receive notifications to reimburse reports in Expensify.
     - Any workspace admin who also has access to the business bank account can be added as a default reimburser.
- **Set a default withdrawal account for the Workspace**:
     - The default bank account is used to reimburse all of the reports submitted on the corresponding workspace. 
- **Set a manual reimbursement threshold to automate reimbursement**:
     - If the total of a given report is less than the threshold set, reimbursement will occur automatically upon final approval.
     - If the total of a given report is more than the threshold, it will need to be reimbursed manually. 

## Set Up Indirect Reimbursement 

A Workspace admin can enable indirect reimbursement via **Settings > Workspaces > Workspace Name > Reimbursement > Indirect**. 

**Additional features under Reimbursement > Indirect:**
If you reimburse through a separate system or through payroll, Expensify can collect and export employee bank account details for you. Reach out to your Account Manager or Concierge to have the Reimbursement Details Export format added to the account.
