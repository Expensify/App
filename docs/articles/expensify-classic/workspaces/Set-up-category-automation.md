Expensify learns how you categorize certain merchants over time and automatically applies that category to future expenses with the same merchant.

- You can always change the category, and Expensify will adjust future categorization based on your corrections.
- Any **Expense Rules** you have set up will take precedence over this automation. This feature only applies if you have not explicitly set a category.

**Note:** This feature only uses categories listed under the selected workspace. To change workspaces, click your profile image and select the correct workspace before adding a new expense.

You can also set up automatic category assignments based on the merchant category code (MCC).

# Set Merchant Code Automation

Expensify automatically detects the merchant type for most imported credit card expenses based on the MCC. To categorize these expenses under a custom category, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings > Workspace > [Workspace Name] > Categories**.
2. Scroll to the **Default Categories** section.
3. Click the **Edit** icon next to the default category you want to update.
4. Select the appropriate category and save your changes.
