description: Automatically add categories to expenses

<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

Expensify learns how you categorize certain merchants over time and then automatically applies that category to the same merchant in the future. However, 
- You can always change the category. Expensify will also learn your corrections over time and adjust how it automatically categorizes them.
- Any expense rules you have set up will always take precedence over this automation. This feature only applies to expenses if you have not explicitly set a category already. 

{% include info.html %}
This feature only uses categories listed under the selected workspace. You can change the workspace by clicking your account profile image and selecting the correct workspace from the list before adding a new expense.
{% include end-info.html %}

You can also set up automatic category assignments based on the merchant code.

# Set merchant code automation

Expensify automatically detects the merchant type for most imported credit card expenses based on the merchant category code (MCC). To have your expenses automatically categorized to one of your custom categories based on the MCC, use the following steps:

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Click the **Group** tab on the left. 
3. Click the desired workspace name.
4. Click the **Categories** tab on the left. 
5. Scroll down to the Default Categories section.
6. Click the Edit icon for the default category to which category will be associated with the default.
