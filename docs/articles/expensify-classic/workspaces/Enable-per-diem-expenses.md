In order for Workspace Members to submit per diem expenses, a Workspace Admin must first enable per diem expenses and set the per diem rates. 

To enable and set per diem rates,

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Click the **Group** tab on the left. 
3. Click the desired workspace name. 
4. Click the **Per Diem** tab on the left. 
5. Click the Per Diem toggle to enable it. 
6. Create a .csv, .txt, .xls, or .xlsx spreadsheet containing four columns: Destination, Sub-rate, Amount, and Currency. Youâ€™ll want a different row for each location that an employee may travel to, which may include states and/or countries to help account for cost differences across various locations. Here are some example templates you can use:
   - [Germany rates]({{site.url}}/assets/Files/Germany-per-diem.csv)
   - [Sweden rates]({{site.url}}/assets/Files/Sweden-per-diem.csv)
   - [Finland rates]({{site.url}}/assets/Files/Finland-per-diem.csv)
   - [South Africa single rates]({{site.url}}/assets/Files/South-Africa-per-diem.csv)
7. Click **Import from spreadsheet**. 
8. Click **Upload** to select your spreadsheet.
