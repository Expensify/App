# Set Per Diem Rates

To enable and set per diem rates:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Per Diem**.
2. Click the Per Diem toggle to enable it.
3. Create a `.csv`, `.txt`, `.xls`, or `.xlsx` spreadsheet containing four columns: **Destination, Sub-rate, Amount, and Currency**. Each row should represent a different location where an employee may travel, including states and/or countries to account for cost differences (see example templates below).
