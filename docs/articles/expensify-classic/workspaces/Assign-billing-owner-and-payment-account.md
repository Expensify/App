<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

The person who creates a workspace will automatically be responsible for the billing for that workspace. However, the existing billing owner can transfer the workspaceâ€™s billing ownership to any Admin on the workspace. 

{% include info.html %}
There can only be one billing owner at a time. Assigning a new billing owner will automatically un-assign the existing billing owner. However, billing owners are also workspace admins by default, and the previous billing owner will remain a workspace admin unless manually updated.
{% include end-info.html %}

# Assign a new billing owner

To assign a new billing owner, **the person who will take over responsibility for the workspace billing must complete the following process**:

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Click the desired workspace name. 
3. Under Workspace Overview, click **Take Over Billing**. 

# Add or update payment account

Once you take over billing for a workspace, you must add a payment method to your account. 

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Account**. 
2. Click the **Payments** tab. 
3. Scroll down to the Payment Details sections and click **Add Payment Card**. 
4. Enter your credit or debit card information and click **Accept terms, add payment card, and pay $0.00** (the box will only show a balance if one is due).
