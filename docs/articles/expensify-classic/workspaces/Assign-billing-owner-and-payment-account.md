The person who creates a workspace is automatically responsible for its billing. However, the existing billing owner can transfer the workspace's billing ownership to any Admin on the workspace.

⚠️ **Important:** There can only be one billing owner at a time. Assigning a new billing owner will automatically un-assign the existing billing owner. However, billing owners are also workspace admins by default, and the previous billing owner will remain a workspace admin unless manually updated.

# Transfer Billing Ownership

To transfer billing ownership, **the person who will take over responsibility for the workspace billing must complete the following process**:

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**.
2. Click the desired workspace name.
3. Under Workspace Overview, click **Take Over Billing**.

# Add or Update Payment Account

Once you take over billing for a workspace, you must add a payment method to your account.

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Account**.
2. Click the **Subscription** tab.
3. Scroll down to the Payment Details section and click **Add Payment Card**.
4. Enter your credit or debit card information and click **Accept terms, add a payment card**, and pay $0.00 (a non-$0 amount will show if there's an outstanding balance due).

Once the billing transfer is complete, the new billing owner will manage payments and subscriptions for the workspace.
