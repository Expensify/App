Invoicing lets you create and send invoices, receive payments, and track the status of your invoices, regardless of whether the customer has an Expensify account. This feature is included with all Expensify subscriptions, no matter the plan — you'll just pay the processing fee (2.9%) per transaction.

# Set Up Expensify Invoicing
Before using the invoice feature, you'll need to [connect a business bank account](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/Business-Bank-Accounts-USD) to Expensify. 

Then, do the following:
1. Log into your Expensify account from the web (not the mobile app)
2. Head to _**Settings > Workspaces > Workspace Name > [Invoices](https://expensify.com/policy?param={"policyID":"20AB6A03EB9CE54D"}#invoices)**_.

Here, you’ll be able to create a markup or add a payment account.

## Add a Logo

From your Expensify account on the web, go to _**Settings > Account > Account Details**_. Then click **Edit Photo** under _Your Details_ to upload your company logo.

## Set the Workspace Currency

To set the currency, head to _**Settings** > **Workspaces** > **Reports**_. This will add default report-level fields to your invoices.  You can see these at the bottom of the [**Reports**](https://expensify.com/reports) page. 

Below are the default report-level fields based on common currencies:
- GBP: VAT Number & Supplier Address (your company address)
- EUR: VAT Number & Supplier Address (your company address)
- AUD: ABN Number & Supplier Address (your company address)
- NZD: GST Number & Supplier Address (your company address)
- CAD: Business Number & Supplier Address (your company address)

## Adding Additional Fields to Invoices

In addition to the default report-level fields, you can create custom invoice fields.

At the bottom of the same Reports page, under the _Add New Field_ section, you’ll have multiple options. 

- **Field Title**: This is the name of the field as displayed on your invoice.
- **Type**: You have the option to select a _text-based_ field, a _dropdown_ of selections, or a _date_ selector.
- **Report Type**: Select _Invoice_ to add the field to your invoices.

Don’t forget to click the **Add** button once you’ve set your field parameters!

For example, you may want to add a PO number, business address, website, or any other custom fields.

_Please check the regulations in your local jurisdiction to ensure tax and business compliance._

## Removing Fields from Invoices

If you want to delete a report field, click the red trashcan on the field under _**Settings** > **Workspaces** > **Reports**_. This will remove that field from all future invoices. 

Unsent invoices will have a red **X** next to the report field, which you can click to remove before sending the invoice to your customer.
