description: Send, receive, and track payments in Expensify 
---
Expensify allows you to create and send invoices, receive payments, and track the status of your invoices, even if your customer does not have an Expensify account. 

{% include info.html %}
You must have a [verified bank account](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/bank-accounts/Connect-US-Business-Bank-Account) added to Expensify to send or accept invoice payments via ACH. Invoice transactions include a 2.9% processing fee per transaction.

## Step 1: Enable invoices for the workspace

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Workspaces**.
2. Click the desired workspace name.
3. Click the **Invoices** tab on the left.
4. Add a payment account if you haven’t already. 
5. Set the markdown percentage (if applicable). 

## Step 2: Customize your invoice
To help your invoice stand out and look more professional, you can: 

1. [Update your profile picture](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/settings/account-settings/Add-profile-photo) to your logo. This logo will appear on your invoices.
2. Set your default [workspace currency](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/workspaces/Set-Currency). This is the currency that will be automatically applied to all invoices. 
3. [Customize the fields](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/reports/Add-custom-fields-to-reports-and-invoices) shown on the invoice. For example, you may want to add a PO number, business address, website, or other custom fields.

Now you’re ready to send invoices to your customers.
