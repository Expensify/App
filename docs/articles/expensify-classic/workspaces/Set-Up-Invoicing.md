Invoicing lets you create and send invoices, receive payments, and track the status of your invoices, regardless of whether the customer has an Expensify account. This feature is included with all Expensify subscriptions, no matter the plan â€” you'll just pay the processing fee (2.9%) per transaction.

# Set Up Invoicing

Before using the invoicing feature, you'll need to [connect a business bank account](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/bank-accounts-and-payments/Business-Bank-Accounts-USD) to Expensify.

Then, follow these steps to set up invoicing:
1. Log into your Expensify account from the web (not the mobile app).
2. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Invoices**.

Here, you can create a markup or add a payment account.

## Add a Logo

From your Expensify account on the web, go to **Settings > Account > Profile**. Click **Edit Photo** to upload your company logo. Once that's complete, the new image will appear on your invoices. 

## Set the Workspace Currency

To set the currency, go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Overview > Report Currency**. Setting the currency adds default report-level fields to your invoices. You can see these at the bottom of the [**Reports**](https://expensify.com/reports) page.

Below are the default report-level fields based on common currencies:
- **GBP**: VAT Number & Supplier Address (your company address)
- **EUR**: VAT Number & Supplier Address (your company address)
- **AUD**: ABN Number & Supplier Address (your company address)
- **NZD**: GST Number & Supplier Address (your company address)
- **CAD**: Business Number & Supplier Address (your company address)

## Add Additional Fields to Invoices

In addition to the default report-level fields, you can create custom invoice fields. For example, you may want to add a PO number, business address, website, or other custom fields.

**Note:** Check local regulations to ensure tax and business compliance.

At the bottom of the **Reports** page, under the _Add New Field_ section, you'll have multiple options:
- **Field Title**: The field's name is displayed on your invoice.
- **Type**: Choose a text-based field, a dropdown selection, or a date selector.
- **Report Type**: Select **Invoice** to add the field to your invoices.

Click **Add** once you've set your field parameters.

# Remove Fields from Invoices

To delete a report field, click the red trashcan icon on the field under **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Reports Fields**. This will remove the field from all future invoices.

Unsent invoices will have a red **X** next to the report field, which you can click to remove before sending the invoice to your customer.
