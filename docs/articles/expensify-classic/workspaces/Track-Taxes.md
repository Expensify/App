If your Workspace is not connected to an accounting system, follow these steps to set up tax tracking:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Taxes**.

   - Add a specific name for the rate.
   - Enter a percentage value.
   - (Optional) Add a unique tax code.

This rate will be applied to all new expenses under this category, overriding the workspace's default currency tax rate.

# FAQ

## How do I set up multiple taxes (GST/PST/QST) for indirect connections?

Expenses sometimes have more than one tax applied to them (for example, in Canada, expenses can have both a Federal GST and a provincial PST or QST). 

To handle multiple tax rates, you can create a new tax rate that combines both into a single rate. For example, if you have a GST of 5% and PST of 7%, you can add them together and create a new tax rate of 12%.

You can generate a CSV from the Reports page containing all the expense information, including the split-out taxes, by going to the Reports tab, clicking **Export To**, and selecting **Tax Report**. 

## How do I handle the taxes for a receipt that includes more than one tax rate?

If your receipt includes more than one tax rate, there are two ways you can handle the tax rate:

- Many tax authorities do not require reporting tax amounts by rate; therefore, you can apply the highest rate on the receipt and then modify the tax amount on the receipt if necessary. Please check with your tax advisor to determine if this approach suits you.
- Alternatively, you can apply each specific tax rate by splitting the expense by the applicable costs for each rate. To do this, open the expense and click **Split Expense**. Then, apply the correct tax rate to each.

## What if my workspace has multiple tax rates?

You'll have the option to change the tax rate from within the expense as needed.

## What should I do if the tax amount for my expense does not show up, or is it showing as a different amount than what I expected? 

In Expensify, tax is *inclusive*, meaning it's already part of the total amount shown. If the tax amount doesn't show up on your receipt or is different from the calculated amount, you can manually type in the correct amount.

To determine the inclusive tax from a total price that already includes tax, you can use the following formula:

**Tax amount = (Total price x Tax rate) รท (1 + Tax Rate)**

For example, if an item costs $100  and the tax rate is 20%:
Tax amount = (**$100** x .20) รท (1 + .**20**) = **$16.67**
This means the tax amount of $16.67 is included in the total.

If you are simply trying to calculate the price before tax, you can use the formula: 

**Price before tax = (Total price) รท (1 + Tax rate)**
