Removing a member from a workspace prevents them from submitting reports to or accessing the workspace. Please note that it does not delete their account or deactivate their Expensify Card.

# Remove a Workspace Member

**Important:** Make sure the employee has submitted all reports, the reports have been approved and reimbursed, and they are in the final approval state.

1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members**.
2. Select the member you'd like to remove and click the **Remove** button at the top of the Members table.
3. If this member was an approver, update the approval workflow:
   - Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members > Approval Mode**.
   - Change the "**Submit reports to**" field to remove them as an approver.

# FAQ

## Will reports from this member on this workspace still be available?
Yes, as long as the reports have been submitted. You can navigate to the **Reports** page and enter the member's email in the search field to find them. However, **Draft reports** will be removed from the workspace, so these will no longer be visible to the Workspace Admin.

## Can members still access their reports on a workspace after they have been removed?
Yes. Any report that has been approved will now show the workspace as "(not shared)" in their account. If it is a **Draft Report,** they will still be able to edit it and add it to a new workspace. If the report is **Approved or Reimbursed,** they will not be able to edit it further.

## Who can remove members from a workspace?
Only **Workspace Admins**. Members cannot add or remove themselves from a workspace. **Domain Admins** who are not also Workspace Admins cannot remove a member from a workspace.

## How do I remove a member from a workspace if I am seeing an error message?
If a member is a **Preferred Exporter, Billing Owner, Report Approver,** or has **Processing Reports,** follow these steps before removing them:

- **Preferred Exporter:**
  - Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Connections > Configure**.
  - Select a different Workspace Admin in the dropdown for **Preferred Exporter**.

- **Billing Owner:**
  - Take over billing on the **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Overview** page.

- **Processing Reports:**
  - Approve or reject the memberâ€™s reports on your **Reports** page.

- **Approval Workflow:**
  - Remove them as an approver by going to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members > Approval Mode**.
  - Change the "**Submit reports to**" field.
