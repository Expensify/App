All Expensify accounts come with an individual workspace where you can track your personal expenses. If you want to connect your personal expenses to an accounting or travel integration, you can create a group workspaceâ€”even if you will be the only person in the group. 

To set up your individual workspace, 

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Click the **Individual** tab on the left. 
3. Select the policy type that best fits your needs. 
4. Set up your workspace details including the workspace name, expense rules, categories, and more.

You can create multiple group workspaces, but you can only create one individual workspace.
