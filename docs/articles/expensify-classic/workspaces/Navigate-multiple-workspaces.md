If you have have multiple workspaces (whether its an individual workspace and a group workspace or multiple group workspaces), you’ll want to 
- Set a default workspace (Some domains have your default automatically set. In this case, you cannot change your default workspace). 
- Select your workspace before creating an expense or report to ensure it’s posted to the correct workspace. 

# Set default workspace

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Click the **Group** tab on the left. 
3. To the right of the desired workspace, click **Make Default** or click the settings icon and select **Make Default**. 

# Select workspace for expenses & reports

Click your profile image and select the workspace from the list at the bottom of the menu. If you have multiple workspaces that you use frequently, always double check that the correct workspace is selected before you create a new expense or report.
