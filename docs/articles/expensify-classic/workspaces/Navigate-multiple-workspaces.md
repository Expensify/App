If you have multiple workspaces—whether an individual workspace and a group workspace or multiple group workspaces—you’ll want to:
- Set a default workspace. (*Note: Some domains automatically set your default workspace, and in these cases, you cannot change it.*)
- Select your workspace before creating an expense or report to ensure it’s posted to the correct workspace.

# Set Default Workspace

Setting a default workspace ensures that new expenses and reports are automatically assigned to the correct workspace, reducing the chance of submitting expenses under the wrong account. This is especially useful if you frequently switch between multiple workspaces.

1. Hover over **Settings** and click **Workspaces**.  
2. Click the **Group** tab on the left.  
3. To the right of the desired workspace, click **Make Default**, or click the settings icon and select **Make Default**.  

## Submit a Report on a Different Workspace

**If you need to submit a report on a workspace other than your default workspace:**
1. Select **New Report** > **Details**
2. Choose a workspace from the Workspace dropdown menu. 
3. Continue to add expenses.

## Change the Workspace for an Open Report

If you frequently switch between multiple workspaces, always double-check that the correct workspace is selected before creating a new expense or report.  

**You can check this by:**
1. Opening the Expense Report
2. Clicking **Details**.
3. Viewing the Workspace

**Note:** If you need to update the workspace that an expense report is on, click the Workspace dropdown list and choose the correct workspace.
