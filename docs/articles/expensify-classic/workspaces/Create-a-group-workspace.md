A workspace is the set of rules, settings, and spending limits for expense reports in your organization. This includes the unique expense categories and tags, budgets, currency and tax settings, etc. that all workspace members will use. A workspace also defines the approval workflow for your employees, as well as the accounting connection if using an accounting software integration.

Here are a couple examples of when youâ€™d want to create different workspaces: 

- You have employees with expense reports in different currencies. For example, you may have a workspace for employees who live in the US and submit their reports in USD and a workspace for employees who live in Canada and submit in CAD.
- You want to limit specific groups of people to their own set of expense coding options (categories/tags) then they can separate their employees by Sales, Marketing, Support, etc. 

To create a group workspace, 

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Workspaces**. 
2. Click the **Group** tab on the left. 
3. Click **New Workspace**. 
4. Enter the workspace name and select a workspace type. 
   - **Collect**: Ideal for small groups who only need basic features like expense approvals, reimbursement, corporate card management, and integration options.
   - **Control**: For groups that need a deeper level of control and configurations, like multi-stage approval workflows, corporate card management, integrations, and more. This is the most popular option. 
5. Set up your workspace details including the workspace name, expense rules, categories, and more.
