You can tag expenses for a specific department, project, location, cost center, customer, etc. You can also use different tags for each workspace to create customized coding for different employees.

You can use single tags or multi-level tags:
- **Single Tags**: Employees click one dropdown to select one tag. Single tags are helpful if employees need to select only one tag from a list, for example their department.
- **Multi-level Tags**: Employees click multiple dropdowns to select more than one tag. You can also create dependent tags that only appear if another tag has already been selected. Multi-tags are helpful if you have multiple tags, for example projects, locations, cost centers, etc., for employees to select, or if you have dependent tags. For example, if an employee selects a specific department, another tag can appear where they have to select their project. 

To add your tags, you can either import them for an accounting system or spreadsheet, or add them manually.

# FAQs

**Why can’t I see a "Do you want to use multiple level tags" option on my workspace.** 

If you are connected to an accounting integration, you will not see this feature. You will need to add those tags in your integration first, then sync the connection.
