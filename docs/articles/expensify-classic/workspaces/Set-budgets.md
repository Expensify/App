Expensify allows Workspace Admins to create budgets to:
- Set monthly and yearly budget caps
- Track spending across categories and tags
- Get notified when a budget reaches a specific limit

You can set budgets for specific categories or tags.
- **Category budgets**: Add budgets for different expense types, such as fees, office supplies, travel, meals and entertainment, and more.
- **Tag budgets**: Add budgets for different departments, projects, locations, cost centers, customers, etc.

Workspace Admins can add Budgets to Control workspaces. This feature is not available for Collect workspaces.
