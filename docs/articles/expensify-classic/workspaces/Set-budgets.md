Workspace Admins on Control workspaces can set monthly or yearly budgets to control team spending across categories or tags. You’ll receive notifications when spending reaches specific limits.

You can set budgets for:
- **Categories**, like office supplies, travel, meals and entertainment, etc.
- **Tags**, like departments, projects, cost centers, or clients.

Budgets are not available for Collect workspaces.
