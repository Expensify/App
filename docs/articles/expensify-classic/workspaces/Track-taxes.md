Expensify's tax tracking allows you to create tax rates and codes for domestic and foreign currencies, and even for different expense categories. 

# Enable tax tracking 

## If connected to an accounting integration

If your Workspace is connected to Xero, QuickBooks Online, Sage Intacct, or NetSuite, 

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Workspaces**.
2. Click the desired workspace name.
3. Click the **Connections** tab on the left.
4. Click **Configure**.
5. Click **Sync Connection**. 

Your tax rates will be imported from the accounting system and indicated by its logo.

## If not connected to an accounting integration

If your Workspace is not connected to an accounting system, 

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Workspaces**.
2. Click the desired workspace name.
3. Click the **Tax** tab on the left.
4. Enable the toggle to allow taxes to be added to expenses.
5. You can modify the existing tax rate, or you can click New Option to add a new tax rate. For each tax rate, you can enable/disable them individually, add a specific name for the rate, add a percent value, and (if desired) add a unique tax code. 
6. Once you have your tax codes added, go to the top of the screen to enter the name that taxes will appear as on expenses. You'll also select which of your tax rates you will use as your defaults for expenses submitted under your workspace currency and foreign currency. 

# Track tax by expense category

You can also set tax rates for specific expense categories:

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Workspaces**.
2. Click the desired workspace name.
3. Click the **Categories** tab on the left.
4. Click **Edit** next to the desired category.
5. Click the Default Tax dropdown and select the desired tax rate.

This rate will be applied to all new expenses under this category, overriding the default currency tax rate for the workspace.
