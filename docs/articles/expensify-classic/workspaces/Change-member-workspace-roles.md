3. Click the desired workspace name. 
4. Click the **Members** tab on the left. 
5. Click the Settings icon next to the desired member. 
6. Select a new role for the member. 

|                           | Employee                         | Auditor | Workspace Admin | 
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|-----------------|
| Submit reports            |  Yes                             |  Yes    |  Yes            |
| Comment on reports        |  Yes                             |  Yes    |  Yes            |
| Approve workspace reports |  Only reports submitted to them  |  Yes    |  Yes            |
| Edit workspace settings   |  No                              |  No     |  Yes            |

7. If your workspace uses Advanced Approvals, select an “Approves to.” This determines who the member’s reports must be approved by, if applicable. If “no one” is selected, then any one with the Auditor or Workspace Admin role can approve the member’s reports. 
8. Click **Save**.
