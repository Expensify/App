# Change a Member's Role or Permissions

To change the roles and permissions for members of your workspace:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members**.
2. Click the **Settings** icon next to the desired member.
3. Select a new role for the member.
4. Click **Save**.

# Advanced Approval

If your workspace uses **Advanced Approvals**, you can select an **Approves to** option. This determines who must approve the member's reports:
1. Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace Name] > Members**.
2. Click the **Settings** icon next to the desired member.
3. Select a new role for the member.
4. Add an approver in the **Approves to** field.
5. Click **Save**.

**Note:** If no one is selected in the **Approves To** field, then any **Auditor** or **Workspace Admin** can approve that memberâ€™s reports. Ensure approval chains are properly configured to avoid delays in report processing.
