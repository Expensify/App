Closing an Expensify account deletes the data tied to it. However, transactions shared with others, including approved and reimbursed company expenses, remain visible to the Admins on the workspace where those reports were submitted. Some transaction records may also be retained for legal compliance.

If you need to leave a **Company Workspace** but want to keep your data:
- Ask the **Workspace Admin** to remove you from the workspace.
- If you own the workspace, you can delete it.

Once removed from the workspace, the account will downgrade to a **free account**, and you will retain access to your historical data.
