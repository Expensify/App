description: Use 2FA for extra login security

<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

Add an extra layer of security to help keep your financial data safe and secure by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA). This will require you to enter a code generated by your preferred authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) when you log in.

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Account**.
2. Under the Account Details tab, scroll down to the Two Factor Authentication section and enable the toggle.
3. Save a copy of your backup codes. 
   - Click **Download** to save a copy of your backup codes to your computer.
   - Click **Copy** to paste the codes into a document or other secure location.

This step is critical—You will lose access to your account if you cannot use your authenticator app and do not have your recovery codes.  
{% include end-info.html %}

4. Click **Continue**. 
5. Download or open your authenticator app and either:
   - Scan the QR code shown on your computer screen. 
   - Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app into Expensify and click **Verify**. 

When you log in to Expensify in the future, you’ll be emailed a magic code that you’ll use to log in with. Then you’ll be prompted to open your authenticator app to get the 6-digit code and enter it into Expensify. A new code regenerates every few seconds, so the code is always different. If the code time runs out, you can generate a new code as needed.
