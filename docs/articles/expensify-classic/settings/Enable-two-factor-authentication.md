title: Enable Two-Factor Authentication
description: Use 2FA for extra login security.
---

Add an extra layer of security to protect your financial data by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA). This requires you to enter a code generated by your preferred authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator) when you log in.

Expensify's 2FA is implemented via a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm. This means that each time you log in, you must use an authenticator app to generate a unique 6-digit code, adding a second “factor” to your login.

## Recommended Authenticator Apps

You can use any authenticator app, but here are a few we recommend:

- [1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/)
- [Authy](https://authy.com/)
- [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447)
- [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app)

Ensure you have an authenticator app installed before proceeding.

# Enable and Set Up Two-Factor Authentication

1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Account**.
2. Under the **Account Details** tab, scroll to the **Two-Factor Authentication** section and enable the toggle.
3. Save a copy of your backup codes:
   - Click **Download** to save a copy to your computer.
   - Click **Copy** to store the codes in a secure location.

This step is critical—If you lose access to your authenticator app and do not have your recovery codes, you will lose access to your account.
{% include end-info.html %}

4. Click **Continue**.
5. Open your authenticator app and either:
   - Scan the QR code displayed on your screen.
   - Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app into Expensify and click **Verify**.

Once set up, when logging into Expensify, you will:
- Receive a Magic Code email to initiate login.
- Be prompted to enter a 6-digit code from your authenticator app.

New codes regenerate every few seconds. If the code expires, generate a new one.

# Lost Recovery Codes or Authenticator App

If you lose your mobile device and recovery codes, a **Domain Admin** can reset your 2FA **only if**:

- You use a company email or a domain you own.
- The Domain Admin also has 2FA enabled.

## Reset 2FA as a Domain Admin

1. Navigate to **Settings > Domains > Domain Members**.
2. Click **Edit Settings** for the affected email address.
3. Click **Reset** to disable 2FA.
4. The user can now log in and reconfigure 2FA.

If your domain does not have 2FA enabled:
1. Go to **Settings > Domains > Domain Members**.
2. Enable **Two-Factor Authentication**.
3. Follow the previous steps to reset 2FA for the user.

{% include info.html %}
If you use a public email (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail), Expensify cannot disable 2FA. If recovery codes are lost, you may need to create a new account with a different email.
{% include end-info.html %}

If no Domain Admin is available, follow [this guide](https://help.expensify.com/articles/expensify-classic/domains/Claim-And-Verify-A-Domain) to verify your domain.

# General Troubleshooting

- Ensure your phone’s time is set to **automatic update**. A manual time difference can cause issues.
- If you are still logged in on another device:
  1. Hover over **Settings**, then click **Account**.
  2. Under the **Account Details** tab, scroll to **Two-Factor Authentication** and disable the toggle.
  3. Try logging in again, then re-enable 2FA.

Following these steps ensures your account remains secure while preventing access issues.
