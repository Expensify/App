Your **primary contact method** on Expensify is used for receiving all notifications and updates. Adding an additional **contact method** enables you to:
- Change your primary Email to a new Email.
- Connect a personal Email as a contact method when your primary Email is employer-provided. This ensures continued account access if your employment changes.
- Log in to your Expensify account using an Email address added as a contact method.
- SmartScan receipts by sending them to receipts@expensify.com from any Email address added to your Expensify account.

**Important:** Before changing your primary contact method, you must add a secondary contact method first.
