You can set your time zone manually or allow Expensify to adjust it automatically based on your location.

Some actions in Expensify are timestamped. To ensure accuracy, make sure your time zone matches your current location.
- **Automatic time zone**: Expensify updates your time zone based on your location.
- **Manual time zone**: You must manually update your time zone when traveling.

**Note:** This process is only available on the Expensify website and cannot be completed from the mobile app.
