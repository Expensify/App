If you have more than one Expensify account—like a personal and a company account—you can merge them. This brings all your reports, receipts, settings, and data into one place.

**Important:** Merging accounts is permanent and cannot be undone.

## Before You Start

Make sure you know:
- Which email address you want to keep as your login going forward.
- Which email address you want to discard and merge in.

> **You must log into the account you want to keep** and merge the one you no longer need into it.
