<div id="expensify-classic" markdown="1">

If you have two Expensify accounts (for example, a personal account and a separate account for your company), you can combine the two accounts by merging them. Once merged, all receipts, expenses, expense reports, invoices, bills, imported cards, secondary logins, co-pilots, and group workspace settings from both accounts will be combined into one account. 

{% include info.html %}
Merging two accounts is a permanent action that cannot be reversed. To merge a company and personal account, you must sign in to your company account and merge your personal account with it. You cannot merge a company account into a personal account, nor can you merge two different company accounts together if they are private domains.
