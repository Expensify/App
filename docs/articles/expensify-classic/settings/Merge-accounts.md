description: Learn how to merge two Expensify accounts into one.
---

If you have two Expensify accounts (e.g., a personal account and a separate company account), you can combine them by merging. This process consolidates all receipts, expenses, reports, invoices, bills, imported cards, secondary logins, co-pilots, and group workspace settings into one account.

{% include info.html %}
Merging accounts is **permanent** and **cannot be undone**. To merge a company and personal account, log in to your **company account** and merge your **personal account** with it. 

- You **cannot** merge a company account into a personal account.
- You **cannot** merge two company accounts if they belong to private domains.
{% include end-info.html %}

*Note: This process must be completed from the Expensify website and is not available in the mobile app.*
