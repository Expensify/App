If you have multiple Expensify accounts—such as a personal and a company account—you can merge them into one. This process consolidates all receipts, expenses, reports, invoices, bills, imported cards, contact methods, Copilots, and group workspace settings into a single account.

**Important:** Merging accounts is **permanent** and **cannot be undone**.

- To merge a company and personal account, log in to your **company account** and merge your **personal account** into it.
- You **cannot** merge a company account into a personal account.
- You **cannot** merge two company accounts if they belong to private domains.

**Note:** This process must be completed from the Expensify website and is not available in the mobile app.
