The primary email address on your Expensify account is the email that receives email updates and notifications for your account. You can add a secondary email address in order to 
- Change your primary email to a new one.
- Connect your personal email address as a secondary login if your primary email address is one from your employer. This allows you to always have access to your Expensify account, even if your employer changes.

{% include info.html %}
Before you can remove a primary email address, you must add a new one to your Expensify account and make it the primary using the steps below. Email addresses must be added as a secondary login before they can be made the primary.

# Adding a new Secondary Login
*Note: This process is currently not available from the mobile app and must be completed from the Expensify website.* 

1. Hover over Settings, then click **Account**.
2. Under the Account Details > Secondary Logins > click **Add Secondary Login**.
3. Enter the email address or phone number you wish to use as a secondary login. For phone numbers, be sure to include the international code, if applicable. 
4. Find the email or text message from Expensify containing the Magic Code and enter it into the field. 

# Changing your Primary Login
If you already have multiple email addresses linked to your account, you can change which one is listed as the Primary Login.

1. Settings > Account > Secondary Logins.
2. Click **Make Primary** next to the email address you want to appear on your account.

You can keep both logins, or you can click **Remove** next to the old email address to delete it from your account. 

# Unlinking an email from your old account
If you at one point added your personal email address as a Secondary Login to your account, and then the account was closed - for example if you had a company account and then left the company - you may want to unlink your personal email to use it with a new Expensify account. You can do this with the following steps:

1. Navigate to the sign in page at expensify.com.
2. Enter your personal email address into the email field.
3. Click **Unlink Accounts**.
4. You will recieve a verification email to complete the unlinking of your personal address.
