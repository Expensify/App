The locked account tool prevents high-risk actions from being taken on accounts that may have been compromised. It safeguards payment activity, contact methods, and account access.

## When is it appropriate to click the button for your own account or for your employee’s account?

Use the **Report Suspicious Activity** button if:
- You suspect unauthorized activity on your own or an employee's account.
- There are changes to bank accounts, logins, or suspicious payment activity.
- You want to pause activity on an account until Concierge investigates.

## Unlocking an account

This button is not reversible without the assistance of an Expensify team member. Once the account is locked, a member of the Expensify team will work with you to take the necessary steps to secure your account and remove any unauthorized access. Only once these steps are taken will the account be unlocked.
