Your **primary email address** on Expensify is used for receiving all notifications and updates. Adding a **secondary email address** enables you to:
- Change your primary email to a new email.
- Connect a personal email as a secondary login when your primary email is employer-provided. This ensures continued account access if your employment changes.
- Log in to your Expensify account using either your primary or secondary email address.
- SmartScan receipts by sending them to receipts@expensify.com from your secondary login.

**Important:** Before removing your primary email, add and make another email the primary. Emails must be added as a secondary login first.
