Expensify uses the timezone set in your account to timestamp certain actions. To ensure accuracy, be sure to set your timezone correctly.

- **Automatic timezone:** Expensify updates your time zone based on your location.  
- **Manual timezone:** You must manually update your time zone when traveling.

**Note:** You can only update your time zone on the Expensify website. This option is not available in the mobile app.
