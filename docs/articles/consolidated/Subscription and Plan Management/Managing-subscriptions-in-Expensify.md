## How to cancel an annual subscription in Expensify

Annual subscriptions are a fixed-term commitment. They cannot be canceled mid-term without approval.

To request early cancellation:

2. Choose the **Request Early Cancellation** option.
3. Submit the request for review.

The request may be automatically approved or reviewed by Expensify. If not approved, charges continue through the end of the subscription term.

Only the billing owner can update the payment method used for subscription charges.

To update your card:

1. Go to your subscription or billing settings.
2. Choose **Update Payment Method**.
3. Enter a valid credit or debit card.

If your current card is expired, invalid, or has insufficient funds, billing actions will be blocked until the issue is resolved.

## When subscription actions are blocked

You may not be able to manage your subscription if:

- You're not the billing owner
- The payment method on file is expired or invalid
- The workspace is on an active annual subscription and early cancellation hasn't been approved

In these cases, you’ll need to resolve the payment issue or request early cancellation before making changes.
