# What billing ownership means in Expensify

Each paid workspace in Expensify has one billing owner. This role controls access to all subscription and billing settings.

---

## What the billing owner can manage

Only the billing owner can:

- View full subscription and billing details
- Update the payment method
- Cancel or request early cancellation of subscriptions
- Delete a paid workspace
- Transfer billing ownership to another Workspace Admin

---

## How billing ownership differs from Workspace Admin access

Being a Workspace Admin does not automatically grant billing permissions.

- Workspace Admins can manage members and workspace settings
- Billing owners manage subscriptions and payment methods

---

## Can multiple people be billing owners?

No. Each paid workspace can only have one billing owner at a time.

To give someone else billing access, the current billing owner must transfer ownership to a Workspace Admin.
