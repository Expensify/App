# What billing ownership means in Expensify

Every paid workspace in Expensify has exactly one billing owner. This role controls access to subscription billing, payments, and workspace-level financial actions.

---

## What the billing owner can do

Only the billing owner can:

- View full subscription and billing details
- Add or update the payment method
- Cancel or request early cancellation of a subscription
- Delete a paid workspace
- Transfer billing ownership to another Workspace Admin

---

## How billing ownership is different from Workspace Admin access

Being a Workspace Admin does not automatically give you billing permissions.

- Workspace Admins can manage members and workspace settings
- Billing owners manage subscription, billing, and payment details

If you're a Workspace Admin and don’t see billing options, you're likely not the billing owner.

---

## Can billing ownership be shared?

No. Each paid workspace can have only one billing owner at a time.

To give someone else access to billing settings, the current billing owner must transfer ownership to a Workspace Admin.

---

# FAQ

## Who is the billing owner of my workspace?

The billing owner is the Expensify account responsible for managing the subscription and payment method for a paid workspace. If you don’t see billing options, you're likely not the billing owner.

---

## Can a Workspace Admin cancel a subscription?

No. Only the billing owner can cancel a subscription or request early cancellation of an annual plan.

---

## How do I transfer billing ownership?

The current billing owner can transfer ownership to another Workspace Admin. The new billing owner must have a valid payment method on file, and the transfer takes effect on the 1st of the next month.

---

## Why can’t I manage subscription settings?

You may not be the billing owner. Only the billing owner can view or update subscription and payment settings. Ask your Workspace Admin to confirm who currently holds the billing role.
