# Expensify Card: Cash Back and Subscription Savings

The Expensify Card helps you save money in two ways: by earning cash back on every purchase and by unlocking lower subscription pricing on the Control Plan. Here's how it works.

---

## How Expensify Card cash back works

The Expensify Card earns cash back on all US purchases automatically. No categories to track, no quarterly activations required.

### Cash back rates

| Monthly Card Spend (across all cards) | Cash Back Rate |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Any amount** | **1%** on all US purchases |
| **$250,000+/month** | **2%** on all US purchases |

**Examples:**
- Your team spends $50,000/month across all Expensify Cards → earn 1% = **$500/month in cash back**
- Your team spends $300,000/month across all Expensify Cards → earn 2% = **$6,000/month in cash back**

Cash back is calculated on your total settled US spending across all Expensify Cards in your organization each month.

---

## Cash back automatically reduces your subscription cost

Your cash back earnings are automatically applied to your subscription bill each month, reducing what you owe.

### How it's applied

1. Your team makes purchases on Expensify Cards throughout the month
2. Expensify calculates your cash back earnings (1% or 2%)
3. Cash back is applied as a credit to your next subscription bill
4. You pay the reduced amount

**Example:**
- Your Control Plan subscription costs $500/month (based on active members)
- Your team earns $200 in cash back this month
- Your net bill is **$500 - $200 = $300**

In many cases, Expensify Card cash back can **fully offset your subscription cost**, making Expensify effectively free.

## Expensify Card unlocks lowest Control Plan pricing

For Control Plan customers, using the Expensify Card unlocks the lowest pricing tier: **$9 per active member/month** (USD only).

### Pricing with and without Expensify Card

| Subscription Type | Expensify Card Required? | USD Price/Member |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Annual + Card** | Yes (50%+ US spend) | **$9** |
| **Annual Only** | No | $18 |
| **Pay-Per-Use** | No | $36 |

**To qualify for $9/member pricing:**
1. Must be on an **Annual Subscription**
2. Must use the **Expensify Card for 50% or more** of your total settled US spending each month

---

## The 50% card spend requirement explained

To maintain $9/member pricing on the Control Plan, your Expensify Card spending must equal at least 50% of your total US business spending.

### How it's calculated

**Expensify Card spend ÷ Total US business spend ≥ 50%**

**Total US business spend** includes:
- Expensify Card purchases
- All other company card purchases (Amex, Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
- Reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses
- Any other business expenses processed through Expensify

### Example: Qualifying for $9/member pricing

Your company's monthly spending:
- Expensify Card: $60,000
- Other company cards: $30,000
- Reimbursements: $10,000
- **Total US spend**: $100,000

**Calculation**: $60,000 ÷ $100,000 = **60%** → Qualifies for $9/member ✔

### Example: Not qualifying for $9/member pricing

Your company's monthly spending:
- Expensify Card: $30,000
- Other company cards: $60,000
- Reimbursements: $10,000
- **Total US spend**: $100,000

**Calculation**: $30,000 ÷ $100,000 = **30%** → Does not qualify ✘  
You'll be billed at $18/member for that month (but still earn cash back on the $30,000)

---

## Collect Plan: Cash back with no spend requirement

On the Collect Plan, you can use the Expensify Card and earn 1% cash back with **no minimum spend requirement**.

- Collect Plan pricing is always **$5 per unique member/month**, regardless of card usage
- Cash back still applies to your subscription bill automatically
- No need to track the 50% threshold

---

## Expensify Card eligibility

To use the Expensify Card, you need:
- A **US business bank account**
- An active **Expensify workspace** (Collect or Control Plan)

The Expensify Card is currently available only to US-based businesses.
