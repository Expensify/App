# Expensify Plan Types and Pricing

Expensify offers two subscription plans—Collect and Control—designed to scale with your team's needs. This guide helps you understand what each plan offers, how much it costs, and which one fits your business best.

---

## Which Expensify plan is right for your team

Expensify has two main plans:

- **Collect Plan**: Best for small teams (up to 10 members) who need simple expense tracking, basic approvals, and essential accounting integrations
- **Control Plan**: Best for mid-size to large teams (10-1,000+ members) who need advanced approvals, bank feed reconciliation, HR integrations, and security controls

Both plans include unlimited SmartScans, ACH reimbursements, and the Expensify Card with cash back.

## Expensify Collect Plan

The Collect Plan is designed for small teams who want straightforward expense management without complexity.

**Pricing**: $5 per unique member per month

**What "unique member" means**: Every person added to your workspace counts as a unique member, regardless of whether they submit expenses that month. Your bill adjusts automatically as you add or remove team members.

**Key features**:
- Unlimited SmartScans (receipt scanning with automatic data extraction)
- Single approver per expense report
- Expensify Card with Smart Limits and 1% cash back on US purchases
- ACH reimbursements (unlimited)
- Accounting integrations: QuickBooks Online, Xero
- Month-to-month subscription (no annual commitment required)

**Expensify Card**: Optional but recommended. Using the Expensify Card earns you 1% cash back on all US purchases, which can offset your subscription cost.

**Eligibility**: The $5/member pricing applies to workspaces created on or after April 1, 2025. If your workspace was created before this date, you may be on a different pricing structure. Contact Concierge or your Account Manager for details.

---

## Expensify Control Plan

The Control Plan provides advanced features for teams that need more control over spending, complex approval workflows, and enterprise-grade integrations.

**Pricing**: $9, $18, or $36 per active member per month (depending on your subscription model)

**What "active member" means**: An active member is anyone who performs billable actions during the month, such as creating, submitting, approving, or exporting expense reports. If someone is added to your workspace but doesn't take any of these actions, they're not billed for that month.

**Pricing tiers**:
- **$9/member/month**: Annual subscription + Expensify Card usage (requires 50%+ of total US spending on the Expensify Card)
- **$18/member/month**: Annual subscription only (no card usage requirement)
- **$36/member/month**: Pay-per-use with no commitment (no annual contract)

**Key features**:
- Unlimited SmartScans
- Multiple approvers and complex approval workflows
- Expensify Card with Smart Limits and up to 2% cash back
- ACH reimbursements (unlimited)
- Bank feed support: Card feeds and automatic reconciliation
- Advanced accounting integrations: NetSuite, Sage Intacct, QuickBooks Desktop, QuickBooks Online, Xero
- HR and payroll integrations: Gusto, Zenefits, Certinia, Workday
- Security and compliance: SAML/SSO and admin-enforced controls

**Expensify Card benefits**: Earn 1% cash back on all US purchases, or 2% if your monthly spend reaches $250,000+. Cash back is applied to your bill first, then deposited to your bank account.

## Who gets billed on each Expensify plan

Understanding who gets billed helps you predict your monthly costs and manage your team size strategically.

**Collect Plan billing**:
- You're billed for every **unique member** added to your workspace
- It doesn't matter if they submit expenses that month—being added to the workspace is enough to count
- Your bill adjusts automatically each month as you add or remove members

**Control Plan billing**:
- You're billed only for **active members** who perform billable actions during the month
- Billable actions include: creating, editing, submitting, approving, reimbursing, or exporting expense reports
- If someone is added to your workspace but doesn't take any of these actions, they're not billed
- Copilots performing actions on behalf of others count as active members
- Automated Concierge actions also count toward active members

## Expensify Card cash back and discounts

The Expensify Card helps offset your subscription costs by earning cash back on your business spending.

**Collect Plan cash back**:

**Control Plan cash back**:

- Earn 2% cash back if your monthly spending reaches $250,000 or more
- The Expensify Card is required to access the discounted $9/member pricing

- Cash back is applied to your monthly bill first, then any remaining amount goes to your bank account

## How to save money on Expensify subscriptions

You can significantly reduce your Expensify costs by combining an annual subscription with the Expensify Card.

**Annual subscription benefits**:
- Lower per-member pricing compared to pay-per-use
- Predictable monthly costs based on committed seat count
- Option to auto-increase seats if your team grows (extends your subscription term)

**Expensify Card benefits**:
- 1-2% cash back reduces your net subscription cost
- For Control plans, card usage unlocks the lowest pricing tier ($9/member vs $18 or $36)
- No fees, no foreign transaction fees, no minimums

**Best savings combination for Control Plan**:
- Annual subscription + Expensify Card usage = $9 per active member/month
- With 2% cash back at high spend levels, your net cost can be as low as $8.82/member

## FAQ

**Why am I being charged more than $5 per member for Collect Plan?**

The $5/member Collect pricing applies to workspaces created on or after April 1, 2025. If your workspace was created before this date, you're on a legacy pricing structure. Contact Concierge or your Account Manager to understand your specific billing.

**Is the Expensify Card required to use Collect or Control Plans?**

- **Collect**: No, the Expensify Card is optional. However, it earns 1% cash back which helps offset your subscription cost.
- **Control**: No, but using the Expensify Card unlocks discounted pricing and up to 2% cash back. Without the card, you'll pay $18/member (annual) or $36/member (pay-per-use) instead of $9/member.

**Can I switch between Collect and Control Plans?**

Yes, you can change your plan anytime:
- For New Expensify, see [Subscription Management for New Expensify](LINK)
- For Expensify Classic, see [Subscription Management for Expensify Classic](LINK)

**What's the difference between unique members and active members?**

- **Unique members** (Collect): Everyone added to your workspace, regardless of activity. If you add 10 people, you're billed for 10 people, even if only 5 submit expenses.
- **Active members** (Control): Only people who perform billable actions (create, submit, approve, export reports) during the month. If you add 10 people but only 5 are active, you're billed for 5.

**How does the Expensify Card usage requirement work for Control Plan pricing?**

To qualify for the $9/member pricing on the Control Plan, you must use the Expensify Card for at least 50% of your total settled US spending each month. This is calculated by dividing Expensify Card spend by total US business spend (including all company cards and reimbursements).

**What happens if I don't meet the 50% card usage threshold?**

If you're on the $9/member pricing but don't meet the 50% card usage requirement in a given month, you'll be billed at the $18/member rate for that month. You can still earn cash back on your Expensify Card spending.

**Are Track and Submit plans still available?**

Track and Submit plans are Individual workspace plans available only in Expensify Classic. For details, see [Plan Types and Pricing for Expensify Classic](../plans-and-pricing/plan-types-and-pricing-expensify-classic.md).
