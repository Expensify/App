# How to Switch Your Expensify Plan

You can upgrade or downgrade your workspace plan anytime to match your team's changing needs. This article covers how to switch plans in both New Expensify and Expensify Classic.

---

## Before you switch plans

### Who can switch plans

Only the **billing owner** can change a workspace's subscription plan.

If you're a Workspace Admin but not the billing owner, you'll need to take over billing ownership first.

### Annual subscription restrictions

If you're on an **Annual Subscription**, you cannot switch plans mid-term unless you:

1. Request **early cancellation** of your annual subscription
2. Wait for approval from Expensify
3. Then switch to a different plan

For month-to-month (pay-per-use) subscriptions, you can switch plans anytime.

## How to switch plans in Expensify Classic

2. Scroll to the **Plan Type** section

## When plan changes take effect

The timing of your plan change depends on your subscription type:

| Scenario | When the Change Takes Effect |
|----------|------------------------------|
| **Upgrade** (Collect → Control) on pay-per-use | Immediately |
| **Downgrade** (Control → Collect) on pay-per-use | 1st of next month |
| **Any change** on annual subscription | After early cancellation is approved and current term ends |

**Why downgrades wait until next month**: This prevents billing disruption and ensures you can use your current plan's features through the end of the paid period.

## Switching between Control Plan pricing tiers

If you're on the Control Plan and want to switch between pricing tiers (e.g., from pay-per-use to annual subscription), follow the same steps as above:

1. Go to your workspace subscription settings
2. Select the new pricing tier (e.g., **Annual + Card**, **Annual Only**, or **Pay-Per-Use**)
3. Confirm the change

**Tip:** Switching from pay-per-use to an annual subscription can reduce your per-member cost from $36 to $9-$18/member (USD). See [Control Plan: Features and Pricing](../plans-and-pricing/Control-Plan-Features-and-Pricing.md).

## What happens to your workspace when you switch plans

When you switch plans:

- **Your workspace, members, and data remain intact**
- **Feature availability updates** based on the new plan
- **Billing adjusts** to the new per-member rate and billing model
- **Integrations may be affected** if you downgrade (e.g., NetSuite is only available on Control Plan)

### Features you gain when upgrading Collect → Control

- Multiple approvers and complex approval workflows
- Bank feed support and card reconciliation
- NetSuite, Sage Intacct, QuickBooks Desktop integrations
- HR/payroll integrations (Gusto, Zenefits, Workday)
- SAML/SSO and domain control

### Features you lose when downgrading Control → Collect

- Multiple approval levels (limited to single approver)
- Bank feed support
- Advanced integrations (NetSuite, Sage Intacct, QuickBooks Desktop)
- HR/payroll integrations
- SAML/SSO

Make sure your team doesn't rely on Control-only features before downgrading.
