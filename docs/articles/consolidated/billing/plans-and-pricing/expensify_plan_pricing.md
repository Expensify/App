# Expensify Plan Pricing and Billing: Annual, Pay-Per-Use, and Localized Rates

This article explains how Expensify billing works, regardless of which paid plan you're on. All paid workspaces follow the same pricing structure, with flexible subscription options and currency support.

# Choose between annual and pay-per-use pricing

Expensify offers two subscription models for all plans:

## Annual pricing
- Commit to a specific number of members for a 12-month term
- Lower cost per member
- Add more members anytime (this extends your commitment)
- Reduce members only after the term ends

## Pay-per-use pricing
- No commitment or contract
- Billed monthly for each active member
- Highest per-member rate

You can choose your pricing model when setting up a workspace or changing your plan.

# Understand how seat billing works

A **seat** refers to a billable member.

- You're billed for **active members** on Control and **unique members** on Collect
- Adding a member mid-cycle increases your bill (for both models)
- Removing a member doesn't reduce your subscription immediately if you're on an annual plan

### On annual pricing:
- You commit to a number of seats
- Seats over the committed number may be billed at pay-per-use rates

### On pay-per-use:
- Billed monthly based on actual usage
- No commitment to a seat count

# View your current pricing model and subscription

# Supported currencies and localized pricing

Expensify supports localized pricing in:
- USD
- GBP
- EUR
- AUD
- NZD

Your pricing will automatically adjust based on the selected billing currency.

To change your billing currency, reach out to **Concierge**.

# When pricing may differ

Your pricing may not match what's shown on the website if:
- Your workspace is on **legacy pricing**
- You have a **discounted enterprise agreement**
- You recently switched from Collect to Control or vice versa

For help confirming your rate, contact **Concierge** or your **Account Manager**.

# FAQ

## Can I switch from annual to pay-per-use?
Yes. You can switch at the end of your current annual term. If you're unsure when that is, reach out to Concierge.

## Can I reduce the number of seats I'm billed for?
Only on pay-per-use. On annual pricing, seat reductions take effect at the end of your subscription term.

## Why did my bill go up?
You may have added more members or gone over your committed seat count. View your billing details to confirm.

## Does pricing include tax?
Pricing does not include tax. Taxes are applied based on your billing location.

## How can I get a pricing quote for my team?
Reach out to **Concierge** or your **Account Manager** and share your expected seat count and usage needs.
