# Expensify Legacy Pricing: Who Qualifies and What It Means

This article explains what legacy pricing is, how to know if you're on it, and how it differs from current Expensify pricing.

# What is legacy pricing

Legacy pricing refers to billing structures that applied before Expensify's current pricing models were introduced.

- Workspaces created **before April 1, 2025** may still be on legacy pricing
- Legacy pricing rates may differ from the current published Collect and Control plan pricing
- Legacy pricing does **not** include new features like card-linked discounts or updated billing logic

# Who qualifies for legacy pricing

You may be on legacy pricing if:
- Your **first workspace** was created before **April 1, 2025**
- You've stayed on the same subscription type without making major changes (e.g. switching between plans)

If your first workspace was created after April 1, 2025, you're automatically on current pricing.

# How to check if you're on legacy pricing

To check:
- Go to your billing settings
- Compare your current pricing against what's shown on the Expensify website
- If your price per member doesn't match current published rates, you're likely on a legacy plan

You can also reach out to **Concierge** to confirm your pricing type.

# What's different about legacy pricing

Legacy pricing plans may:
- Have a flat monthly rate regardless of activity or seat type
- Not support annual commitment discounts
- Exclude eligibility for Expensify Card-based pricing benefits

These plans still function, but they may not offer the same flexibility or rewards as current plans.

# Should I switch to current pricing?

It depends on your team's size, card usage, and need for flexibility.

Switching may make sense if:
- You want to access cash back or pricing discounts from Expensify Card usage
- You prefer an annual commitment model with reduced rates
- You need features only available in current plans (e.g. Control-level exports, integrations)

Before switching, compare your current monthly cost against current plan rates or contact your Account Manager.

# FAQ

## Why is my Expensify bill different from what's shown online?
If you're on legacy pricing, your rates won't match the current published rates. That's expected and not an error.

## Can I stay on legacy pricing?
Yes. As long as you don't make changes to your plan, you can remain on your legacy rate.

## Can I switch from legacy to current pricing?
Yes. You can opt into current pricing anytime. If you're on an annual plan, the change will apply at the end of your current term.

## Will I lose access to any features if I stay on legacy pricing?
You won't lose existing features, but you won't gain access to pricing-linked features like card-based discounts or Control-specific tools.

## Who can help me review my pricing?
Reach out to **Concierge** or your **Account Manager**. They can confirm your plan and help you decide if switching is right for your team.
