# Expensify Card: How Pricing Discounts and Cash Back Work

Using the Expensify Card unlocks pricing benefits and earns you cash back, no matter which plan you're on.

# Discounted pricing with the Expensify Card

You can qualify for discounted pricing on **any paid Expensify plan** by using the Expensify Card.

To unlock the discount:
- You must be on an **annual subscription**
- At least **50% of your total settled U.S. spend** must be on the Expensify Card during the billing period

If you meet the requirement:
- Your annual per-member price is discounted (see [pricing article](#))
- The discount is automatically applied to your bill

If you don't meet the requirement:
- You're billed at the standard annual rate
- The card can still earn cash back, even if the discount doesn't apply

# Cash back rules for the Expensify Card

All Expensify Card spend in the U.S. is eligible for cash back.

## Cash back rates
- **1%** on all eligible U.S. purchases
- **2%** if your workspace reaches **$250,000 or more** in U.S. card spend in a calendar month

## Where cash back is applied
- First, it is applied to your **Expensify bill**
- If you earn more than your bill amount, the remainder is **paid out to your connected bank account**

# The Expensify Card is optional

You can use any Expensify plan without the Expensify Card. However:

- On **Collect**, the card doesn't change your price but still earns cash back
- On **Control**, the card is required if you want discounted pricing

# How to track your card usage for discounts

You can view your card spend and discount eligibility in the workspace billing section.

- **New Expensify:** Go to **Settings > Workspaces > [Your Workspace] > Billing & Subscriptions**
- **Expensify Classic:** Go to **Settings > Account > Subscription**, then open your workspace

# FAQ

## Do I need the Expensify Card to use Collect or Control?
No. The Expensify Card is optional for all plans. It only affects pricing if you're on an annual plan and meet the spend threshold.

## What happens if I stop using the Expensify Card?
If card usage drops below the 50% threshold, you lose the discounted rate for that billing cycle. You'll be charged the standard annual price.

## Can I still earn cash back if I don't qualify for the discount?
Yes. Cash back is separate from the pricing discount and applies to all eligible U.S. spend.

## What spend qualifies toward the 50% card threshold?
Only **settled U.S. transactions** on the Expensify Card count. International spend and pending transactions do not apply.

## When is the 2% cash back applied?
If your workspace hits $250,000+ in U.S. Expensify Card spend in a single calendar month, 2% cash back applies to that month's total spend.

## Can I combine cash back with other discounts?
Yes. Cash back applies independently of pricing discounts and will always be applied first to your bill.

## Where can I see my current discount status?
Go to your workspace billing section to see current card usage and discount eligibility:
- **New Expensify:** Settings > Workspaces > [Workspace] > Billing & Subscriptions
- **Expensify Classic:** Settings > Account > Subscription > [Workspace]
