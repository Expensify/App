# Expensify Collect Plan: Features and Pricing

The Collect Plan is designed for small teams who need straightforward expense management without the complexity of enterprise features. It's perfect for teams with up to 10 members who want essential tools at an affordable price.

---

## Who the Collect Plan is for

The Collect Plan works best for:

- Small teams with up to 10 members
- Startups and growing businesses
- Teams that need simple approval workflows (single approver)
- Companies using QuickBooks Online or Xero for accounting
- Teams who want month-to-month flexibility with no annual commitment

## Collect Plan pricing

The Collect Plan uses a simple, predictable pricing model based on unique members.

### Pricing by currency

| Currency | Price per unique member/month |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| **USD ($)** | $5 |
| **GBP (£)** | £5 |
| **EUR (€)** | €5 |
| **AUD (AU$)** | AU$8 |
| **NZD (NZ$)** | NZ$9 |

**No annual commitment required** — the Collect Plan is month-to-month, giving you flexibility to scale up or down as your team changes.

## How unique member billing works on Collect Plan

On the Collect Plan, you're billed for every **unique member** added to your workspace, regardless of whether they submit expenses that month.

**Examples:**
- You add 10 people to your workspace → you're billed for 10 members
- Only 5 of those people submit expenses → you're still billed for 10 members
- You remove 3 people next month → you're billed for 7 members

Your bill adjusts automatically each month as you add or remove team members.

**Why this matters**: The Collect Plan is priced for predictable small team costs. If your team size fluctuates significantly or many members are inactive each month, the Control Plan's active member billing may be more cost-effective. See [Choosing Between Collect and Control Plans](../plans-and-pricing/Choosing-Between-Collect-and-Control-Plans.md).
