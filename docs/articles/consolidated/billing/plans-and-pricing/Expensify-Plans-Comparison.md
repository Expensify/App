This article explains **how Expensify plans and pricing work**, so you can choose the plan that best fits your team and understand how billing is calculated. Pricing, eligibility rules, and billing logic are consistent across platforms, even though pricing may be displayed differently in New Expensify and Expensify Classic.

# Choose the right Expensify plan

Expensify offers two paid plans:

- **Collect**, designed for small teams that want simple, predictable expense tracking
- **Control**, designed for growing organizations that need advanced approvals, controls, and integrations

Each plan uses a different billing model and defines billable members differently.

# Understand the Collect plan and pricing

## Understand who the Collect plan is for
Collect is best for teams that want straightforward expense tracking with simple monthly pricing.

## Understand who gets billed on the Collect plan
On Collect, billing is based on **unique members**:

- Every unique member added to the workspace is billed
- Member activity does not matter
- Your bill adjusts monthly as members are added or removed

## See Collect pricing by currency
Collect is always billed month-to-month. There are no annual contracts.

Pricing by currency:
- **USD:** $5 per unique member per month
- **GBP:** £5 per unique member per month
- **EUR:** €5 per unique member per month
- **AUD:** AU$8 per unique member per month
- **NZD:** NZ$9 per unique member per month

## Understand how the Expensify Card affects Collect pricing
The Expensify Card is **optional** on Collect.

- Using the card does not change your Collect subscription price
- If you use the card, you earn **1% cash back** on U.S. purchases
