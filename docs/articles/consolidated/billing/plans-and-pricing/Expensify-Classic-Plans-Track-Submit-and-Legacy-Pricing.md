# Expensify Classic Plans: Track, Submit, and Legacy Pricing

Expensify Classic offers two specialized plans for Individual workspaces: **Track** and **Submit**. These plans are designed for individuals managing personal expenses, not teams. This article also explains legacy pricing for older accounts.

**Note**: Track and Submit plans are **only available in Expensify Classic** for Individual workspaces. Group workspaces use Collect or Control plans instead.

---

## What are Individual workspaces in Expensify Classic?

Individual workspaces are for personal expense tracking without team collaboration. They're different from Group workspaces, which are designed for teams.

| Workspace Type | Who It's For | Plans Available |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Individual** | One person managing personal expenses | Track, Submit |
| **Group** | Teams with multiple members | Collect, Control |

If you need team features, accounting integrations, or multiple approvers, you'll need a Group workspace with a Collect or Control plan instead. See [Collect Plan: Features and Pricing](../plans-and-pricing/Collect-Plan-Features-and-Pricing.md) or [Control Plan: Features and Pricing](../plans-and-pricing/Control-Plan-Features-and-Pricing.md).

## Legacy pricing in Expensify Classic

If your Expensify Classic workspace was created **before April 1, 2025**, you may be on a **legacy pricing structure** that differs from current plan pricing.

### What legacy pricing means

Legacy pricing refers to older subscription models that were in place before Expensify updated its pricing structure. If you're on legacy pricing:

- Your subscription costs may differ from the current rates shown for Collect and Control plans
- You're grandfathered into your existing pricing as long as you maintain your subscription
- You can continue using your current plan at your legacy rate

### How to check if you're on legacy pricing in Expensify Classic

**On web:**
1. Hover over **Settings** and click **Workspaces**
2. Select your workspace
3. Click **Subscription** to view your current pricing

If your pricing doesn't match the current Collect or Control rates, you're likely on a legacy plan.

### Should you switch from legacy pricing?

It depends. Compare your current rate to the current plan pricing:

- If your legacy pricing is **lower** than current rates → Keep your legacy plan
- If your legacy pricing is **higher** than current rates → Consider switching to a current plan

Contact **Concierge** or your **Account Manager** for a detailed comparison based on your specific account.
