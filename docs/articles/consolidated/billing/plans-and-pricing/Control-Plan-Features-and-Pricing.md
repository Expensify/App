## Control Plan pricing

The Control Plan offers three pricing tiers based on your subscription model and Expensify Card usage. You're billed only for **active members** each month.

### Pricing tiers explained

| Subscription Type | Expensify Card Required? | USD | GBP | EUR | AUD | NZD |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Annual + Card** | Yes (50%+ US spend) | $9/member | Not available¹ | Not available¹ | Not available¹ | Not available¹ |
| **Annual Only** | No | $18/member | £14/member | €16/member | AU$30/member | NZ$32/member |
| **Pay-Per-Use** (no commitment) | No | $36/member | £28/member | €32/member | AU$60/member | NZ$64/member |

¹ The $9/member tier with Expensify Card discount is currently available only for USD billing.

**Annual subscription**: Fixed-term commitment with lower per-member pricing  
**Pay-per-use**: Month-to-month with no commitment, but higher per-member cost

## How active member billing works on Control Plan

On the Control Plan, you're billed only for **active members** who perform billable actions during the month.

### What counts as a billable action

An active member is someone who:
- Creates an expense or expense report
- Submits an expense report
- Approves an expense report
- Reimburses an expense report
- Exports expense reports to accounting systems
- Acts as a Copilot performing actions on behalf of others

**Automated Concierge actions** also count toward active members.

### Examples

- You add 20 people to your workspace
- Only 12 people submit, approve, or export expenses that month
- You're billed for **12 active members** (not 20)

This billing model helps you save money when team members are inactive, on leave, or seasonal.

**Why this matters**: If your team is consistently active, the Control Plan's active member billing can be more cost-effective than Collect's unique member billing. See [Choosing Between Collect and Control Plans](../plans-and-pricing/Choosing-Between-Collect-and-Control-Plans.md).

## Expensify Card usage requirement for $9/member pricing

To qualify for the $9/member pricing tier (USD only), you must:

1. Be on an **Annual Subscription**
2. Use the **Expensify Card for 50% or more** of your total settled US spending each month

**How it's calculated**: Expensify Card spend ÷ Total US business spend (including all company cards and reimbursements) ≥ 50%

**If you don't meet the 50% threshold**: You'll be billed at the $18/member rate for that month. You can still earn cash back on your Expensify Card spending.

# FAQ

## How much does the Control Plan cost?

Control Plan pricing ranges from $9-$36 per active member per month (USD), depending on whether you have an annual subscription and use the Expensify Card. See the pricing table above for all currencies.

## What does "active member" mean?

An active member is anyone who performs billable actions (creating, submitting, approving, or exporting expense reports) during the month. If someone is added to your workspace but doesn't take these actions, they're not billed.

## Is the Expensify Card required for Control Plan?

No, but using the Expensify Card unlocks the lowest pricing tier ($9/member with an annual subscription) and earns you 1-2% cash back. Without the card, you'll pay $18/member (annual) or $36/member (pay-per-use).

## Can I downgrade from Control to Collect Plan?

Yes, you can downgrade anytime (unless you're on an active annual subscription). See [How to Switch Your Expensify Plan](../plans-and-pricing/How-to-Switch-Your-Expensify-Plan.md).

## What integrations are included with Control Plan?

The Control Plan includes all accounting integrations (NetSuite, Sage Intacct, QuickBooks Desktop/Online, Xero) and HR/payroll integrations (Gusto, Zenefits, Certinia, Workday).

## What's the difference between annual subscription and pay-per-use?

**Annual subscription**: Fixed-term commitment with lower pricing ($9 or $18/member). You can set up auto-increase to add seats as your team grows.  
**Pay-per-use**: Month-to-month with no commitment, but higher pricing ($36/member).
