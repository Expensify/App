## When to choose Collect Plan

Choose Collect if:

- Your team has **10 or fewer members**
- You need **simple, single-approver workflows**
- Your accounting needs are met by **QuickBooks Online or Xero**
- You want **month-to-month flexibility** with no annual commitment
- You prefer **predictable per-member pricing** ($5-$9/member)

**Best use cases**:
- Startups and small businesses
- Teams with consistent member activity
- Companies that don't need bank feed reconciliation

## When to choose Control Plan

Choose Control if:

- Your team has **10+ members** (especially if many are inactive each month)
- You need **multiple approvers or complex approval workflows**
- You require **bank feed support** for card reconciliation
- You use **NetSuite, Sage Intacct, or QuickBooks Desktop**
- You need **HR/payroll integrations** (Gusto, Zenefits, Workday)
- Your organization requires **SAML/SSO or domain control**

**Best use cases**:
- Mid-size to enterprise companies
- Teams with seasonal or variable member activity
- Organizations with complex approval hierarchies
- Companies that need enterprise security and compliance

## Understanding unique members vs active members

The billing model is the key difference between Collect and Control plans:

### Collect Plan: Unique members

- **Who gets billed**: Everyone added to your workspace, regardless of activity
- **Example**: Add 10 people → billed for 10, even if only 5 submit expenses
- **Best for**: Teams where most/all members are active each month

### Control Plan: Active members

- **Who gets billed**: Only people who perform billable actions (submit, approve, export)
- **Example**: Add 20 people → only 12 are active → billed for 12
- **Best for**: Teams with inactive members, seasonal staff, or approvers-only roles

---

## When to upgrade from Collect to Control

Consider upgrading from Collect to Control when:

1. **Your team grows beyond 10 members**, especially if some are inactive
2. **You need multiple approval levels** (e.g., manager → department head → finance)
3. **You require bank feed reconciliation** for company cards
4. **Your accounting system isn't QuickBooks Online or Xero** (e.g., you use NetSuite or Sage Intacct)
5. **You need HR/payroll integrations** like Gusto or Workday
6. **Your organization requires SAML/SSO** for security compliance
