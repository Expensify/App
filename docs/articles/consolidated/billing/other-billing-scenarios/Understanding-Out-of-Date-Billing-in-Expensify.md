When billing is out of date in Expensify, your workspace may lose access to paid features. This guide explains what it means, why it happens, and how to resolve it.

# What "out-of-date billing" means in Expensify

Out-of-date billing means Expensify couldn't successfully charge your payment method for your subscription or usage.

When billing is out of date:
- Some workspace features may be limited
- You'll see alerts or warnings in the app
- You won't be able to make billing changes until the issue is fixed

# Why billing becomes out of date

Billing usually becomes out of date for one of these reasons:

## Your payment method failed

A charge might fail if:
- The card on file is expired or invalid
- The account has insufficient funds

## A retry attempt didn't go through

If a failed charge isn't resolved, Expensify may automatically retry the payment. If that also fails, billing stays out of date until it's retried successfully.

## Your trial ended without an upgrade

If your workspace was on a free trial:
- Billing becomes out of date when the trial ends
- You'll need to upgrade to a paid subscription and add a valid payment method

# Who can resolve out-of-date billing

Only the **billing owner** can fix billing issues.

The billing owner can:
- Update or add a payment method
- Retry failed payments
- Upgrade from a trial to a paid subscription
- Transfer billing ownership if needed

Workspace Admins can't perform billing actions unless billing ownership is transferred to them.

# How to fix out-of-date billing in Expensify

To restore billing and unlock full access:

- **Update your payment method** to ensure a valid card or bank account is on file
- **Retry the failed charge** once the issue is resolved
- **Upgrade your workspace** if your trial has ended
- **Transfer billing ownership** to a Workspace Admin who can take action

# What happens after billing is fixed

Once billing is successfully resolved:
- The "out-of-date billing" alert disappears
- Workspace features go back to normal
- Expensify resumes billing based on your plan and usage

If issues continue after retrying the payment, double-check the payment method or confirm who the billing owner is.

# FAQ

## Why do I still see a billing alert after adding a new card?

Adding a new card doesn't automatically retry the failed charge. You may need to manually retry the payment.

## Can a Workspace Admin fix out-of-date billing?

No. Only the billing owner can take billing actions. If you're a Workspace Admin, the billing owner will need to transfer ownership to you first.

## What happens if I don't fix out-of-date billing?

If billing isn't resolved:
- Paid features stay limited
- Billing-related changes are blocked
- You may lose access to certain functionality

## Does this mean my subscription was canceled?

No. Your subscription is still active, but restricted until billing is resolved.

## Why did billing go out of date when my trial ended?

Free trials don't include automatic billing. You'll need to upgrade your workspace and add a payment method to continue using paid features.

## Will I be charged right away after fixing billing?

Yes. Expensify will collect any outstanding charges based on your current subscription and usage once billing is resolved.
