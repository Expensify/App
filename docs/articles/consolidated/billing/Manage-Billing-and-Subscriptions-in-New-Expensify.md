This article explains **how billing owners complete billing and subscription actions in New Expensify**. For information about permissions, eligibility, cancellation rules, and ownership transfer timing, see **Understanding Billing Ownership & Subscription Management**.

# Where to manage billing and subscriptions

All billing and subscription management in New Expensify is located under **Account > Subscription**.

## Access subscription settings

- **Web:** Click your profile icon, then go to **Account > Subscription** using the left-hand navigation
- **Mobile:** Tap the **Account** tab at the bottom, then select **Subscription**

# View subscription details

If you are the billing owner, you can view your subscription details from **Account > Subscription**, including:
- Current subscription or plan
- Number of seats
- Renewal date and renewal status
- Auto-renew status
- Auto-increase annual seats (if enabled)
- Payment method on file

If you do not see subscription details, you are likely not the billing owner for the workspace.

# Update your billing payment method

Only the billing owner can add or change the payment card used for billing.

To update your payment method:
1. Go to **Account > Subscription**
2. Click **Add a payment card** or **Edit** next to the existing card
3. Enter the new card details and save

The updated card will be used for future subscription charges.

# Request early cancellation of an annual subscription

If you are on an annual subscription and eligible for early cancellation, you can submit a request directly from New Expensify.

To request early cancellation:
1. Go to **Account > Subscription**
2. Click **Request early cancellation**
3. Follow the prompts to submit your request

Early cancellation requests may be approved automatically or reviewed by the Expensify team. This option is only available to the billing owner.

# Stop billing for a paid workspace

To stop being charged for a paid workspace in New Expensify, you must either:
- Delete the paid workspace, or
- Transfer billing ownership to another Workspace Admin

If you are on an annual subscription, early cancellation must be approved before the final paid workspace can be deleted.

# Delete a workspace in New Expensify

Only the billing owner can delete a paid workspace.

To delete a workspace:
1. Go to the **Workspaces** tab
2. Locate the workspace you want to delete
3. Click the three dots next to the workspace name
4. Select **Delete workspace**
5. Confirm when prompted

**Important notes:**
- Workspace deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Deleting a workspace does not delete your personal Expensify account or historical expense data
- If this is your last paid workspace on an annual subscription, early cancellation must be approved first

# Transfer billing ownership in New Expensify

Billing ownership can be transferred to another **Workspace Admin**.

To transfer billing ownership:
1. Confirm the new owner is a Workspace Admin on the workspace
2. Have the new owner follow the billing ownership transfer flow
3. The new owner adds a valid payment method

Billing ownership transfers on the **1st of the following month**. Until the transfer is complete, the current billing owner remains responsible for charges.

# When you can’t manage billing or subscriptions

You may be unable to update billing, cancel a subscription, or delete a workspace if:
- You are not the billing owner
- The workspace is on an active annual subscription without early cancellation approval
- The payment method on file is invalid or expired

If you are a Workspace Admin and need billing access, you can transfer billing ownership to yourself.
