# Expensify Subscription Overview

Every Expensify workspace operates on a subscription model that determines which features are available and how billing works. This overview explains the basics of Expensify subscriptions and how billing is managed.

---

## What an Expensify subscription is

An Expensify subscription is the billing arrangement for your workspace. Your subscription includes:

- The plan type (Collect, Control, Track, or Submit)
- The number of active or unique members
- Payment method and billing owner
- Subscription term (monthly or annual)

Each workspace has its own subscription managed independently by a billing owner.

## How Expensify billing works

Expensify bills workspaces monthly based on your plan and team size. Billing is handled automatically through the payment method on file.

### Billing models

Expensify uses two different billing models depending on your plan:

**Unique member billing** (Collect Plan):
- You're billed for every member added to your workspace
- Billing happens regardless of whether they use the workspace that month
- Predictable monthly cost based on team size

**Active member billing** (Control Plan):
- You're only billed for members who perform billable actions during the month
- Billable actions include creating, submitting, approving, or exporting expenses
- Cost varies month-to-month based on actual usage

---

## Who manages subscriptions

Every paid workspace has exactly one **billing owner**. Only the billing owner can:

- View subscription details and billing history
- Update the payment method
- Cancel or modify the subscription
- Delete the workspace
- Transfer billing ownership to another admin

Workspace Admins have separate permissions to manage members and workspace settings, but cannot access billing unless they are also the billing owner.

---

## Subscription pricing by currency

Expensify subscriptions are billed in your local currency when available:

- USD ($)
- GBP (£)
- EUR (€)
- AUD (AU$)
- NZD (NZ$)

Pricing varies by currency and plan type. For specific rates, see the pricing details for your plan.

## Managing your Expensify subscription

- Review your current plan and pricing
- Update your payment method
- Change subscription terms (monthly vs annual)
- Upgrade or downgrade plans

# FAQ

## Do I need a subscription to use Expensify?

Individual workspaces in Expensify Classic can use the free Track plan. Group workspaces and all New Expensify workspaces require a paid subscription (Collect or Control).

## Can I have multiple subscriptions?

Yes. If you own multiple workspaces, each has its own independent subscription and billing owner.

## What happens if my payment fails?

If Expensify can't charge your payment method, your billing becomes out of date. You'll see alerts in the app and may lose access to paid features until billing is resolved. See [How to fix out-of-date billing](../other-billing-scenarios/Understanding-Out-of-Date-Billing-in-Expensify.md).

## Can I switch between monthly and annual billing?

Yes. You can change your subscription term from the subscription settings. Annual subscriptions offer lower per-member pricing but require a fixed-term commitment.

## Who gets billed if I'm part of multiple workspaces?

Each workspace bills its own billing owner independently. If you're a member of multiple workspaces, you're not billed directly—each workspace's billing owner is charged for their team.
