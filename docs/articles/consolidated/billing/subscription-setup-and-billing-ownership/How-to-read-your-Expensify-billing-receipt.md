# Billing breakdown section on your Expensify receipt

This section lists **line-by-line charges and member types** that make up your total bill.

You might see:

- **Inactive members @ $0.00** — Members who did not trigger billable activity
- **Chat-only members @ $0.00** — Members who only used Expensify Chat
- **Annual Control members @ $18.00** — Members on an annual Control plan
- **Pay-per-use Control members @ $36.00** — Active members on pay-per-use pricing
- **Collect members** — Members using the Collect plan
- **Expensify Card discounts or cash back credits** — Applied automatically when eligible

Each row shows the member type, quantity, price per member, and subtotal.

# What counts as a billable member

A member is billable if they take any **billable action** on a report during the billing period.

This includes:
- Creating, editing, or submitting reports
- Approving, rejecting, commenting on, or reimbursing reports
- Exporting reports
- Sharing or unsharing reports
- Acting as a Copilot for another member taking those actions

## When Expensify Chat activity counts as billable

A member is also considered active (and billable) if they send **more than two messages** in a billing period:
- To **Concierge** or an **Account Manager**
- Within any **workspace chat room**

Chat-only users who stay under this threshold are listed as **Chat-only members @ $0.00**.

---

# Activity breakdown by workspace

Your receipt includes an **Activity breakdown** that shows charges by workspace.

You'll see:
- Workspace name and unique ID
- Total amount charged for each workspace

If all activity occurred in one workspace, only that one will be listed.

**ADD A SCREENSHOT HERE.** Suggestion: Activity breakdown section showing Workspace name, ID, and subtotal.

# Discounts and cash back on your Expensify bill

You may see credits that reduce your total charges. These can include:
- **Cash back credits** from eligible Expensify Card spend
- **Expensify Card discounts** that lower your Control plan rate
- **ExpensifyApproved! discounts** for accounting firms in the partner program

These credits appear in the **Billing breakdown** as negative line items.

**ADD A SCREENSHOT HERE.** Suggestion: Line item showing Expensify Card discount or cash back credit.

# Expensify Classic terminology differences

If you're using Expensify Classic, you might notice slight label differences:

- "Receipt" may appear as an **invoice**
- Billing details may appear under **Billing History**
- Section names might differ, but calculations and member logic are the same

These are display-only differences.

# FAQ

## Why was I charged for more members than I expected?

You may have members who took **billable actions** without your knowledge, such as submitting or editing a report, commenting, or using Copilot. Review the **Billing breakdown** section of your receipt to see who triggered activity.

## What does "Chat-only member @ $0.00" mean?

This means the member only used Expensify Chat and didn't take any billable actions during the billing period. They are not charged.

## Why are some members listed at $0.00?

Members at $0.00 either:
- Didn't take any billable actions (inactive), or
- Only used Expensify Chat (chat-only)

These members are shown on your receipt for transparency but are not charged.

## Why was I charged for Copilot activity?

If you acted as a Copilot — or someone acted as a Copilot for you — **both people are billed** when a billable action is taken. This ensures activity is tracked to both accounts.

## How can I reduce my Expensify bill?

You can:
- Encourage use of the **Expensify Card** to earn discounts and cash back
- Consolidate workspaces to reduce duplicate activity
- Remove unneeded members or adjust roles to limit access

## Where can I see a breakdown of active members?

While the receipt shows member counts by type, you can get a **full active user breakdown** by visiting:

**Web:** `Settings > Workspaces > Subscription > View billing history`

Then click on a receipt to view active users for that billing cycle.

## Why does the receipt mention "You're missing out on $X savings"?

This is a promotional message showing how much you could save by moving all spend to the Expensify Card. It does not affect your current charges.

## Can I download past billing receipts?

Yes. Go to:

**Web:** `Settings > Workspaces > Subscription > View billing history`

Click any receipt to download a copy.
