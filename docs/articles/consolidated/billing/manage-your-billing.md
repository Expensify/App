# How billing ownership and subscription management work in Expensify

Each paid workspace in Expensify has one **billing owner** who controls subscription and payment settings. This article outlines what the billing owner can do, how ownership works, and what happens when you cancel or delete a workspace.

---

## Who can manage billing and subscriptions in Expensify

Only the **billing owner** of a workspace can:

- View full subscription and billing details
- Update the payment method on file
- Cancel a subscription
- Delete a paid workspace
- Transfer billing ownership to another Workspace Admin

If you don’t see billing options, you're likely not the billing owner for that workspace.

## What is billing ownership in Expensify

The billing owner is the Expensify account responsible for all subscription charges tied to a specific paid workspace.

- Every paid workspace has one billing owner
- This role determines who can take actions related to payments and subscriptions
- Workspace Admins do not automatically have billing permissions

## Billing owner vs Workspace Admin permissions

| Action                             | Billing Owner | Workspace Admin |
|------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Manage workspace members and settings | ✅            | ✅               |
| View and update subscription        | ✅            | ❌               |
| Add or update payment method        | ✅            | ❌               |
| Cancel subscription                 | ✅            | ❌               |
| Delete workspace                    | ✅            | ❌               |

**Note:** Billing ownership can be transferred to a Workspace Admin.

## How to update the subscription payment method

Only the billing owner can update the payment method used for a paid workspace.

- Expired or invalid cards will block billing actions
- You must resolve payment issues to manage the subscription

---

## How to cancel a subscription in Expensify

### Monthly subscriptions

- Can be canceled by the billing owner at any time
- The subscription ends at the end of the current billing period

### Annual subscriptions

- Are fixed-term and cannot be canceled mid-term without approval
- Billing owners can request **early cancellation**
- Requests may be automatically approved or manually reviewed

If the request is denied, billing continues until the end of the subscription term.

---

## How subscription status affects workspace deletion

A workspace’s billing status affects whether it can be deleted:

- Only billing owners can delete paid workspaces
- Workspaces with active **annual subscriptions** cannot be deleted unless early cancellation is approved

**Note:** Deleting a workspace does **not** delete the billing owner’s Expensify account or past expense data.

---

## How to delete a workspace in Expensify

Only the billing owner can delete a paid workspace.

- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Final charges may still apply for the current billing cycle
- Deleting one workspace does not cancel other active subscriptions

---

## How to transfer billing ownership in Expensify

Billing ownership can be transferred to another **Workspace Admin**. Here’s how it works:

- The new billing owner must be a Workspace Admin
- They must add a valid payment method
- Ownership transfers on the **1st of the next month**

After the transfer, the new billing owner takes over all future billing responsibility.

---

## Why billing actions may be blocked

You won’t be able to manage subscriptions or make billing changes if:

- You’re not the billing owner
- The payment method is expired or invalid
- An annual subscription is active without early cancellation approval

In these cases, you’ll need to either update the payment method, request early cancellation, or transfer billing ownership.

# FAQ

## Who can cancel an Expensify subscription?

Only the billing owner can cancel a subscription. Workspace Admins do not have access to billing actions unless they are also the billing owner.

---

## Can I delete a workspace if the subscription is still active?

If the workspace is on a monthly subscription, yes — deletion is possible. If it’s on an annual subscription, deletion is blocked unless early cancellation is approved.

---

## How do I transfer billing ownership to another member?

The current billing owner must choose a new **Workspace Admin** and initiate the transfer. The new billing owner must add a valid payment method. The transfer completes on the 1st of the next month.

---

## Can I manage billing without being the billing owner?

No. Only the billing owner can update payment methods, cancel subscriptions, or delete workspaces.

---

No. Your Expensify account and historical expense data will remain even if you delete a workspace.
