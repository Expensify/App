# How to delete a workspace in Expensify

Only the billing owner of a paid workspace can delete it. This article explains the steps to delete a workspace, when deletion may be blocked, and what happens after it's deleted.

---

## Who can delete a workspace in Expensify

Only the billing owner can delete a paid workspace.

- Workspace Admins cannot delete the workspace unless they take over billing ownership first
- If you don't see the option to delete, confirm whether you're the billing owner

---

## When workspace deletion is blocked

A workspace cannot be deleted if:

- It is on an active annual subscription without early cancellation approval
- There is a failed or pending payment
- You are not the billing owner

To resolve this:

- Submit an early cancellation request if on an annual plan
- Update the payment method if billing has failed
- Transfer billing ownership if needed

---

## What happens when a workspace is deleted

- The workspace is permanently removed, including its settings and members
- Billing stops after the final usage period is completed
- Deletion does **not** delete your Expensify account or historical expenses

If you own multiple workspaces, deleting one does not affect the others.
