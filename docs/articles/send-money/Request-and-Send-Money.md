# How do these Payment Features work?
Our suite of money movement features enables you to request money owed by an individual, split a bill with a group, and proactively send money for a one-off expense.

**Request Money** lets your friends pay you back directly in Expensify. When you send a payment request to a friend, Expensify will display the amount owed and the option to pay the corresponding request in a chat between you.

**Split Bill** allows you to split payments between friends and ensures the person who settled the tab gets paid back.

**Send Money** allows you to send money to someone proactively. With this feature, you can Send Money to a friend without receiving a payment or split bill request.

These three features ensure you can live in the moment and settle up afterward.

# FAQs
## Send Money Payment: Why is the option to Pay With Expensify not visible to me?
If “I’ll Settle Elsewhere” is showing for you when you’re trying to send money, this is because we don’t support money movement through Expensify in your jurisdiction yet. You can use “I’ll settle elsewhere” if you want to track the payments for audit in Expensify.

## I’ve received a payment request/bill split from a friend in a DM. Do I use Send Money to send this payment?
No. Click the green “Pay” button in the payment preview in the DM, and this will ensure you are paying the accompanying Payment or Bill Split request - canceling out the IOU to 0.

## Can I request money from more than one person at a time?
If you need to request money for more than one person at a time, you’ll want to use the Split Bill feature. The Request Money option is for one-to-one payments between two people.
