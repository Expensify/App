## How to set up your conference on Expensify Chat

Based on our experience running conferences atop Expensify Chat, we recommend the following simple steps:

### Step 1: Create your event workspace in Expensify 

To create your event workspace in Expensify:
1. In new.expensify.com: “+” > “New workspace” 
2. Name the workspace (e.g. “ExpensiCon”)

### Step 2: Set up all the Expensify Chat rooms you want to feature at your event

*Protip*: Your Expensify account manager can complete this step with you. Chat them in #admins on new.expensify.com to coordinate!

To create a new chat room:
1. Go to [new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com)
2. Go to “+” > New room  
3. Name the room (e.g. “#social”)
4. Select the workspace created in step 1
5. Select “Public” visibility 
6. “Create room” > Copy/Paste room URL for use later
7. Repeat for each room

For an easy-to-follow event, we recommend creating these chat rooms:

- *#announce* - This room will be used as your main announcement channel, and should only be used by organizers to announce schedule updates or anything important that your attendees need to know. Everyone in your policy will be invited to this channel, but chatting in here isn’t encouraged -- so to keep the noise to a minimum!
- *#social* - This room will include all attendees, speakers, and members of your organizing team. You can use this room to discuss social events, happy hours, dinners, or encourage attendees to mingle, share photos and connect. 
- *Create an individual room for each session* - Attendees will be able to engage with the speaker/session leader and can ask questions about their content either before/during/after the session.
- *Create a room with your Expensify account manager/s* - We can use this room to coordinate using Expensify Chat before, during, and after the event. 

### Step 3: Add chat room QR codes to the applicable session slide deck

Gather QR codes:
1. Go to [new.expensify.com](https://new.expensify.com)
2. Click into a room and click the room name or avatar in the top header
3. Go into Share Code
4. Download or screenshot the QR code image

Add the QR code to every slide so that if folks forget to scan the QR code at the beginning of the presentation, they can still join the discussion. 

### Step 4: Train speakers on how to use chat during their sessions

*Protip*: Copy and paste a link to this section and share it directly with your speakers
*Protip*: Your account manager can communicate this training to your speakers. Chat with them in #admins on new.expensify.com to coordinate!

Are you a speaker at an event? Great! Expensify Chat is the perfect way to connect with your session attendees before, during, and after the event. Use Expensify Chat to introduce yourself and your topic, and open the floor for attendees to ask questions and participate in discussion about your presentation, as well as connect with other attendees that were in the room. Here’s a quick list to help you best prepare for your session by using Expensify Chat: 

1. Ensure your session has an Expensify Chat room and that you know the URL link to your session so you can share with attendees ahead of time
2. Join the chat room ahead of the event so you can start engaging with your session’s attendees from the get-go
3. Make sure you have a session moderator with you on presentation day to help moderate questions and facilitate discussion while you’re busy speaking
4. Ensure your session slides include the QR code for your session chat room. We’d recommend making sure the QR code is visible on every page of your deck in case an attendee didn’t join at the beginning. 
5. Engage with attendees after your session to continue the discussion around your topic!

*Messaging Suggestions*

- Default: Welcome to [CONFERENCE NAME]! This is the [SESSION TITLE] chat room. Please use this room to chat with each other, submit questions about today's presentation, and to chat directly with [SPEAKER NAME] after the session wraps up.
- Custom: As part of pre-conference speaker outreach we should allow speakers to change this message and use the default if they don’t respond.”

### Step 5: Plan out your messaging and cadence before the event begins

Expensify Chat is a great place to provide updates leading up to your event -- share news, get folks excited about speakers, and let attendees know about crucial event information like recommended attire, travel info, and more.

### Step 6: Update your rooms throughout the event 

We find chat to be a powerful way to not only engage your attendees, but direct them in realtime to get exactly where they need to go:

- #announce: Use this room to make announcements such as what’s coming up next, where and when social events are taking place, or announcing the sponsor floor is open to the entire conference. Only workspace admins can post in this room.
- #social: Have your employees in this room sharing fun photos, stoking conversations, and responding to any questions or feedback.
- Speaker rooms: Encourage your employees to jump in to comment on content and nudge attendees to engage with each other during sessions.

*Protip*: Expensify Chat has moderation tools to help flag comments deemed to be spam, inconsiderate, intimidating, bullying, harassment, assault. On any comment, just click the flag icon to moderate conversation. 

### Step 7: Follow up with attendees after the event

Continue the connections by using Expensify Chat to keep your conference community connected. Encourage attendees to share photos, their favorite memories, funny stories, and more. 

- We’d recommend creating a draft of all of your reminders that you plan to send in the #announce (or #social) room throughout the event. 
- A post in the morning outlining the full agenda, and then before each event as it happens throughout the day, is recommended. Be sure to include details like timings, locations, and any special detail like attire to help attendees feel prepared.
- Use markdown when posting updates so that your messages are easy to read.
- We also recommend posting your updates on new lines so that if someone has a question about a certain item they can ask in a thread pertaining to that topic, rather than in one consolidated block. 

## You’re all set!
