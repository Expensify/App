# `react-native` patches

### [react-native+0.81.4+001+initial.patch](react-native+0.81.4+001+initial.patch)

- Reason: Fixes keyboard flickering issue when opening/closing modals. When an input is blurred and a modal is opened, the `rootView` becomes the `firstResponder`, causing the system to retain an incorrect keyboard state. This leads to keyboard flickering when the modal is closed. The patch adds code to resign the `rootView`'s `firstResponder` status before presenting the modal to prevent this issue.

### [react-native+0.81.4+002+fixMVCPAndroid.patch](react-native+0.81.4+002+fixMVCPAndroid.patch)

- Reason: Fixes content jumping issues with `MaintainVisibleContentPosition` on Android, particularly in bidirectional pagination scenarios. The patch makes two key improvements:
  1. Changes when the first visible view is calculated - now happens on scroll events instead of during Fabric's willMountItems lifecycle, which was causing incorrect updates
  2. Improves first visible view selection logic to handle Fabric's z-index-based view reordering by finding the view with the smallest position that's still greater than the scroll position

### [react-native+0.81.4+004+iOSFontResolution.patch](react-native+0.81.4+004+iOSFontResolution.patch)

- Reason: Fixes font resolution issues on iOS by properly preserving font properties when loading fonts by name. When a font is loaded by its name, the patch now correctly extracts and uses its actual weight and style properties instead of ignoring them.

### [react-native+0.81.4+005+resetAutoresizingOnView.patch](react-native+0.81.4+005+resetAutoresizingOnView.patch)

- Reason: This is a workaround fix for an issue with `UIPageViewController` and Fabric's view recycling system. The problem occurs because pager-view was incorrectly using a Fabric-provided view as its content-view. This is problematic because `UIPageViewController` modifies its content view, and when Fabric later recycles this modified view, it can lead to unexpected layout issues. The patch addresses this by resetting the autoresizing mask on the view to prevent layout corruption when views are recycled. The root cause should be addressed in react-native-pager-view: https://github.com/callstack/react-native-pager-view/issues/819

### [react-native+0.81.4+023+textinput-prevent-focus-on-first-responder.patch](react-native+0.81.4+023+textinput-prevent-focus-on-first-responder.patch)

- Reason: On iOS, a text input automatically becomes the "first responder" in UIKit's "UIResponder" chain. Once a text input becomes the first responder, it will be automatically focused. (This also causes the keyboard to open)
    - This is not handled by React or React Native, but is rather a native iOS/UIKit behaviour. This patch adds an additional `TextInput` prop (`preventFocusOnFirstResponder`) and a ref method (`preventFocusOnFirstResponderOnce`) to bypass the focus on first responder.
    - In E/App this causes issues with e.g. the keyboard briefly opening after a modal has been dismissed before another modal is opened (`ReportActionContextMenu` -> `EmojiPicker`)
- Upstream PR/issue: None, because this is not a real bug fix but a hotfix specific to Expensify
- E/App issue: [#54813](https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/54813)

### [react-native+0.81.4+025+restore-interaction-manager.patch](react-native+0.81.4+025+restore-interaction-manager.patch)

- Reason:

    ```
    This patch restores the old InteractionManager behavior. React Native 0.80 deprecated InteractionManager and modified
    it to behave like `setImmediate`, more info here - https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/d9262c60f4c02d66417008970dc9c34b742aaa75/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L597
  
    We need to restore the previous behavior to avoid introducing any bugs in the app.
    Bug example - https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/69535#issuecomment-3443059319
    ```

- Upstream PR/issue: There won't be any upstream changes. We need to get rid of InteractionManager
