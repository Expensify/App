### [react-native-web+0.20.0+007+fix-scrollable-overflown-text.patch](react-native-web+0.20.0+007+fix-scrollable-overflown-text.patch)

### [react-native-web+0.20.0+008+fix-nested-flatlist-scroll-on-web.patch](react-native-web+0.20.0+008+fix-nested-flatlist-scroll-on-web.patch)

- Reason:
  
    ```
    Adds a logic to conditionally call `preventDefault()` only on the scroll container that matches the gestureâ€™s axis (and nesting/inversion state), instead of unconditionally, so nested FlatLists â€” especially orthogonal (H-in-V or V-in-H) and inverted â€” can both receive events and scroll correctly.
    ```

- Reason:
  
    ```
    Ensures that web implementation of inverted FlatList scrolls in only one direction at a time by comparing X and Y deltas, then choosing the direction with the bigger delta.
    ```

### [react-native-web+0.20.0+010+fullstory-support.patch](react-native-web+0.20.0+010+fullstory-support.patch)

- Reason:
  
    ```
    Adds support for Fullstory props to `Text`, `TextInput`, `TouchableWithoutFeedback` and `View` components, eliminating the need to use hacky workarounds to apply Fullstory masking/metadata properties to them.
    ```
  
- Upstream PR/issue: The patch isn't something we can apply to upstream because we are specifically allowing custom props used by Fullstory to be forwarded to their respective DOM elements.
- E/App issue: As explained above the current solution can't be applied to upstream because it's tailored to Fullstory needs.
- PR introducing patch: https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/67552
