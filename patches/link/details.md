### [link+2.1.1+001+hot-load.patch](link+2.1.1+001+hot-load.patch)

- Reason:
  
    ```
    This patch enables us to develop react-native-live-markdown from the TS source and have it hot-reload in E/App.

    ```
  
- Upstream PR/issue: ðŸ›‘, this is related to Expensify/react-native-live-markdown and it seems like a customization, so it makes sense there's no upstream issue.
- E/App issue: Same as the PR.
- PR introducing patch: https://github.com/Expensify/App/pull/47794
