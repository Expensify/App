# `@sentry/react-native` patches

### [@sentry+react-native+7.4.0.patch](@sentry+react-native+7.4.0.patch)

- Reason: Fixes React Native path resolution in the Sentry Ruby script during iOS builds. The original implementation failed to locate `react-native/package.json` in our hybrid app setup. The patch changes the resolution strategy to first try resolving from the installation root (similar to react-native-svg and react-native-reanimated), and falls back to ENV variables with support for both node_modules conventions.
