# This `.xcode.env` file is versioned and is used to source the environment
# used when running script phases inside Xcode.
# To customize your local environment, you can create an `.xcode.env.local`
# file that is not versioned.

# NODE_BINARY variable contains the PATH to the node executable.
#
# Customize the NODE_BINARY variable here.
# For example, to use nvm with brew, add the following line
# . "$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh" --no-use
export NODE_BINARY=$(command -v node)

# Provide a sourcemap path so that in release builds a source map file will be
# created at the specified location.
# (RN's default behaviour on iOS is to skip creating a sourcemap file):
export SOURCEMAP_FILE="$(pwd)/../main.jsbundle.map";
